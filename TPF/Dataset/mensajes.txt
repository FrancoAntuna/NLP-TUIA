If you have in the mash, a 4 and a 5 red, you can't add them together into a 9 red - they turn into a 4 red wine and a 5 red wine, correct? The adding only happens when you create a blush or champagne, right?

My wife is teaching me the game and she seemed to think yes, but I don't see it anywhere in the rules.

You cannot combine same-color grapes to create wine in Viticulture. Thanks for playing!

Player A has left the winter season including retrieving workers. A different player then plays a card which allows every player to train a worker which player A does.
I was thinking that the trained worker would stay there until A again has a chance to retrieve workers at the end of the next year. Others said that he would be able to use it for the next year. Which is correct?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good question! The player who has passed out of the year receives the worker right away (they can place that worker in the upcoming year, just not the current year since they have already passed).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the response. Is that something clear from the written rules already (and if so which) or was it an ambiguity that is now being clarified?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stay where? The worker in this context goes straight to the player. Where would you be ‘keeping’ the worker for later?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew, when you train a worker in Viticulture, it stays near the "train a worker" action--you don't get it until when you retrieve workers at end of year. That's why Bob was asking about this. In the example he provided, a player has already passed out of the year (and thus already completed their "retrieve worker" step).

Bob: I'm providing the answer as the designer of the game; I did not reference the rules for the answer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then I think we’ve been playing this card incorrectly, because (from memory, so I may be wrong about this recollection!) I think we’ve always played it that if you choose to train a worker from a card option, you gained the worker immediately.

Bob - what was the exact card that was played?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some cards do say to gain the worker to use in the current year. That's why it's always helpful for questions to include the exact text on the card (or a photo).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guest Speaker: All players may pay 1 Lira to train 1 worker. Gain 1 victory point for each opponent who does this.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was in the game with Bob… I don’t remember what the card was, but it surely did not say “can be used in this season.”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I cannot say with certainty whether we would use this worker immediately…. (Clearly we shouldn’t!).
But glad to know a finished player gets to use them the following year.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not to contradict Jamey, but this question is posed in the Viticulture rules forum (not Tuscany or World expansions), and in the base game, you don't retrieve workers until /everyone/ has finished Winter and passed for the year.

I assume you're playing with either the Tuscany or World expansions, in which case a player who passes out of winter retrieves all their workers off the board, freeing up those spaces for other players.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You're right! In Tuscany those steps happen when you pass, but in core Viticulture all players do those steps together after the winter season, so any workers trained during the year (even if you've passed) are still on the board and would all be retrieved anyway.

Hello everyone

1. "Apprentice. After taking an action with this worker you may immediately place your Grande worker on the same space (not an action space)."
Are we missing something here? Even without this power the grande can still go here anyway. The only effect we see is it happens immidiately, but compared to all the other awesome powers this seems almost like not a power at all.

2. Has anyone created any fan designs for more special workers? There are several blank cards to utilize.

Background: We love this game. We have played all the expansion content including the original expansion content. We mainly only play the essential content now + special workers & extra wine cards. We have played 150+ games.

Happy gaming!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can confirm, the power of the apprentice is that it lets you take two (of the same) action at once. This can be powerful when wanting to get more done quickly and still be able to take other actions on later turns before those other spots are filled up. I'll leave the other question to fans. I'm glad you're enjoying Viticulture!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Theoretically wouldn't this let you take an action a second time that otherwise couldn't be done twice? Like the yoke space on your player board?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good question, but no. The grande worker is limited to being placed on the main board.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Normally yes, but normally you also can't place the grande worker immediately after placing another worker either. So if we grant that this card modifies the rules regarding the placement of the grande worker, then I don't see why it wouldn't also modify where the grande worker can be placed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the grande can be placed anywhere anyway so the power does work, but seems very minimal in comparison to all the oher powers.
Thanks for the responses though!

Any fan power creations?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don’t think it should affect your game if this is a “weaker” Special Worker, because whichever two special workers you end up with in your game are available to all players, so no one will be advantaged or disadvantaged.

P.s. there are more ‘official’ Special Workers available at either the Stonemaier or Meeple Source websites.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It isnt affecting our game & we have those already.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can see it being helpful in the fall with harvesting all at once, and thus allowing your second action to be making wine with the possibility of getting the bonus. Cant really think of too many other advantages of the apprentice.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 3333938:
Could you win by choosing the wake up position #6 for the victory point every year?
Pretend that you are able to do so. Would it be enough to win with average point gain everywhere else?
Did anyone actually pull this off?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The game is usually over in six or seven rounds. Naturally every VP is important, but unless you're setting yourself up to score a big chunk of points in the last two rounds, usually buy fulfilling wine contracts or multiple customer cards, it's going to be difficult to win by focusing on a single VP point here or there (If that's the crux of your strategy).

I'm not saying that that's what you're proposing, but it's good to know that there is no single space for a dominant strategy. That being said it's also important for other players to prevent one player from taking the obvious easy VP spots.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, it doesn’t guarantee a win. It can certainly help, but you’ll constantly be at a disadvantage for placing meeples.

Title.

Using the action in summer that lets you sell or buy a field, or sell a grape, and the bonus space gives you a victory point. What if you sold and bought the same field over and over, getting the victory point each time? Pretend you beat the other players to this spot.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes this is legal, but not quite as dominant as one might think it is.

Greetings, I am playing Viticulture in Android. I have built both the medium and large cellars. I currently have 3 red grapes of values 4, 3 and 2. I am trying to make a value red wine by choosing 4, 3 grapes. The app is not allowing me to make the wine. Same issue when I choose 4, 3 and 2 red grapes to make value 9 red wine. The app is not allowing me to choose a wine spot in the cellar.
I don't have this issue when making blush of values 7, 8 and 9. Can guide me on what I am doing wrong?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can't add grapes together to make a red or a white wine. One grape only for those.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As mentioned above from Carl, you cannot combine grapes. You can only age your grapes and wine to higher values or combine vines in fields to make higher values.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Except when making blushes or sparkling
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 3284723:
If I want to make sparkling wine and I have a red grape 4,a red grape 3 and a white grape 3 can I still make sparkling wine of value 9( even if the total sum is 10) or do I have to have the exact value of the grapes?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wines of any kind cannot have values higher that 9.

This means that your first suggestion is correct.
The resulting sparkling wine would be value 9.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As long at the total is equal to or exceeds the wine you want to make, you've met the requirement. Exact value isn't needed, and no "change" is given.

This has been a really tough game for me to grok for some reason. I tried it a few years ago on BGA and liked the theme and it seemed interesting, but I couldn't get the hang of the strategies and really found it a brain burn which was strange as I play lots of euros. It just doesn't come naturally to me for some reason, which seems odd as the visitor cards feel similar to minors/occs in Agricola which I'm well familiar with.
I'd like to watch a good playthrough video which I can learn strategy from and see the game flow better and improve my ability to make wine and fill orders- which I struggle the most with. Can anyone recommend any to help?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't know any videos, but for me Viticulture is all about the visitor cards. It is the most interesting/fun part of the game and also can generate the most points. So here are 3 tips to consider:
1) Build your Cottage early and start getting cards......you'll have a blast!!
2) to get money early sell a field (do it when you can get a victory point for doing so)
3) Late in the game, going first is worth more than any reward on the wake up track.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This search turned up a few potentially useful videos: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=viticulture+str...

Including some tips from Jamey himself!

Plenty of play through videos on Youtube too, although I'm not sure how many talk about strategy.

There's also quite a few threads about strategy here on BGG as well, e.g. https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1511898/viticulture-strateg...

***This BGG forum post was composed as a course requirement for a liberal arts seminar at
Central College (Modern Board Game Studies: Immersion & Design, SP24). Constructive feedback
and conversation from all BGG users is welcomed and encouraged!***

At its core, Viticulture is a worker placement game where players compete to build and manage their own vineyards. Each decision feels meaningful, whether it's choosing which grapes to plant, upgrading your winery, or fulfilling orders for discerning customers. With access to increase the number of workers you have; the game doesn't feel too strained when it comes to the number of decisions that can be made each season.

Viticulture does a GREAT job of balancing out the usual kinks of worker placement games through the usage of powers granted by cards and certain powers granted to each player. Like most worker-placement games, there a limited number of spots within each action-territory that workers can go into. Once these spots are taken, in most games, that action in then blocked until workers are removed from the board. However, in viticulture, each player has what's called a Grande Worker which can be placed into any territory regardless of spot availability. This not only makes things easier for people who aren't as adept at worker-placement games while also giving more experienced players more options for strategy. This is one of the many things that Viticulture does right when it comes to making the game more exciting for everyone whether it be by making the game easier or adding more options for strategies.

When playing worker-placement games, I've always felt that towards the end of a round, I either put workers in places that I don't really need/want due to low availability of spots or due to having done everything I had wanted to do during that round. I think Viticulture does a great job of giving options to players where every worker placed has an impact on the player's strategy and/or their overall gameplay. It didn't ever feel like I was throwing away workers just because I had them on hand. As the game progresses, you have the option to increase the number of workers you're able to use each round. I think the pacing of this action is perfect in Viticulture. It felt as if every time I increased my worker count by one I had at least one more thing that I wanted to do in the next round making it feel like the game was progressing at the same pace as the players were.

My one gripe I had when it came to playing Viticulture was the usefulness/diminishing returns of certain structures such as the windmill. For those who don't know, the windmill gives the player a bonus amount of Lira (currency) after planting grapes in your field. After the first/second rounds it felt as if it wasn't even worth my Lira (currency) let alone my worker to build the windmill as its effects had been cut down due to the nature of the first round in which players have most likely already planted grapes in their fields. Uprooting the grapes from your fields and replanting is an option--yes, however, this set of actions doesn't seem to be efficient unless under certain circumstances. I played through the whole game without building the windmill and there wasn't a single time where I thought to myself "I wish I had the windmill right now for this". Obviously, I'm not a game designer, however, one thing I came up with that might increase some of the structures' value would be to create cards (whether those be summer/winter visitors, grapes, etc.) that you can only activate if you have the certain structure or have the card state a BONUS action/reward for playing the card while having the structure built. I think making some of the structures more useful in such a way would not only make the game feel a little more complete but could also drastically change the strategies of the players.

Overall, I really liked the game and consider it one of my favorite worker-placement games that I've played. The game is mostly self-motivated, in which the players take actions to benefit themselves, however there are opportunities where you can make obstacles for then other players. Which in my opinion is more fun, as no one really has the option of playing the game just to make your life miserable. Viticulture is a wonderful game that I believe can be played by any group of people.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You're not alone: I and I suspect many others never see the benefit of spending all that money to build a Windmill or a Tasting Room - they are expensive, and by the time you can afford to build one, you tend not to need to do the Plant or Give a Tour actions any more (and, for the Tasting Room, the new rules say you have to have wine in your cellar in order to get the bonus point). The other structures have much more utility and some are vital to succeed at the game (e.g. Trellis, Irrigation, Medium Cellar and Large Cellar.) Cottage is nice as it gives you extra visitor cards, but it's not essential. Yoke is useful especially in multiplayer games where there's a lot of competition for the 'Harvest' spots.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 3213509:
I have a question about the Bonus Action Tokens. I understand that you take the glass bead in the wake-up slot, but a little fuzzy on when and where you can use it. Do you have to use it on a worker placement spot that you took during your turn? So, basically doing that spot twice? Can you use it on any spot, even if the Automa is covering that spot on that turn? Can you use it for a bonus action that neither you or the Automa are on? So, if you place your worker on a draw a winter visitor space, would you use that bonus to play another winter visitor card space? Or if you are on the play a winter visitor, could you use it for a Place a one order action that is blocked by the Automated?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Barb. The glass token allows you to take one of the bonuses on the action where you placed your worker that turn. See the example below:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As you are playing a 2 player game, you would need to place your worker on the left most space. Notice how that space does not provide a bonus. By spending a glass token, you gain the bonus of 1 lira (shown on the middle space), in addition to taking the action.

Have fun,
David

Foreword:
This review is part of a 3-part series where I revisit some of my favorite Stonemaier titles (Scythe, Viticulture, and Wingspan) and share my impression of these signature titles. I’m a bit of a Viticulture veteran and have played it at all player counts with/without expansions, right down to the beautiful “wine crate” full edition storage crate. I’ll walk you through the basics and let you decide for yourself. As a player that is constantly playing new titles, it’s rare for me to revisit the same one multiple times. With over a dozen plays of this game, it’s one of my most played.
From the Publisher:
In Viticulture, the players find themselves in the roles of people in rustic, pre-modern Tuscany who have inherited meager vineyards. They have a few plots of land, an old crushpad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.

The players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There’s competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.
Fortunately for the players, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.
Using those workers and visitors, players can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines (vine cards), and filling wine orders (wine order cards). Players work towards the goal of running the most successful winery in Tuscany.

Favorite:

One of the most notable things in this game is its two distinctly different worker placement zones. When this game came out, it was the first time I experienced a worker placement that didn’t just have multiple zones on the board you could unlock or pay for, it had two sides that could only access specific actions based on the season. Using this a core hook, they built income and renewal/proliferation steps into the change of seasons that brought the game to a whole new level.
Least Favorite:
It can be a huge disadvantage to go later in a turn when there can only be a specific number of worker spaces available per action vs player count. They do two things to offset this: Provide a “grande” worker who can go on any action even if the space(s) are full, and allow a draft for turn order at the start of each turn. Still, I have found myself wishing for a second grande worker so often I feel it should almost be addressed. At 2 players and 6 players I think this is most noticeable.

Rules:
The full rulebook for Viticulture – and any other Stonemaier title – can be found in this dropbox link:
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/f2tekc23yvb27w3/AAD5_JSbWVuEujhwS...
Areas they did well:
– Balanced unique starting abilities and cards
– Bidding/drafting system for turn order
– Two unique areas for worker placement actions
– Cost vs reward of actions and cards
– Variety of cards and card abilities
– Excellent component quality
– Thematic tie-in
– Proliferation and income steps
– Opening new positions on actions based on player count
– Game end trigger is based on how the game plays out and a target VP, not a set number of years/seasons
– Plays well at any player count without sacrificing experience
– Solo mode
– Good reward sharing aspects

IMAGE

Areas they could have improved:

– I’d like the final worker you buy to have grande powers
– I think starting with a free wine order would be a benefit for early strategy
– It could be interesting to be able to plant any vine but it only provides half the grapes until you build the structure required.
– I’ve almost always sold a field when I play and never had a need for a third.
– Can be subject to a lot of luck where it has a fair reliance on card drawing and/or what an opponent does.
– A draw 2 pick one mechanic might give the game a little more agency.
Interesting moment:
In a recent game, an opponent played the “Planner” summer visitor card. This card allowed them to place a worker in the winter season before other players had a chance to get there. As a result, they claimed the Fill action and secured themselves a guaranteed wine order, while everyone else would have to use their Grande worker if they had it still available, or a Winter visitor card that allowed a player to fill an order. What’s more, they were set to go last in the new season and got to jump turn order for that move. It was a key play that resulted in a huge point shift. Great use of the card.
Overall:
The seasonal worker and visitor idea was wonderfully executed and added to the reasons that this game is so well received. I got to admit, it isn’t perfect and I still have my frustrations with it. In fact, I’ve inwardly grumbled on the luck aspect or not having access to an action many times. But that’s all a part of it and you either got to embrace it or pass on the game altogether. I feel if you are the type of player to get bent out of shape that a random occurrence just isn’t fair or that your strategy gets derailed due to a space getting filled before you had a chance to go there, then this isn’t for you. If you can get over a few small bumps in the road and still have a smile on, then you’ll have a blast making and selling some wine!

Final Thoughts:
Whether it was intentional or a happy accident, this game has proved to be equally appealing to men and women alike that I have played with. It’s been a great intro game for me to play with my non-gaming friends who thoroughly love the theme and wine making process. It’d be a nice date or double date choice, or even a night with your family or parents. I love how games have the ability to bring people together at the table and encourage meaningful conversations and overall feeling of belonging and bonding. I think this title does that better than most and for that reason among others, I play it often.
I’ll see you next time, back here at The Game Table,

This might be a stupid question and I apologise if so. Can you sell wine without a wine order?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the base game you cannot unless some visitor card ability allows you too. However if you are playing the Tuscany expansion game board then yes, you can sell your wine for vp without a wine order via a action in the winter season.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 3065107:
On page 6: "When placed on a full action space, a player may take the action and the bonus in any order, but they may only gain the bonus if they complete the action. "
I'm confused here. If we can get bonus only if we complete the action, then there's no "in any order". Is this should be corrected as "if they CAN complete the action"? Say I have 3 dollors and lack of 1 dollor to build a facility, can I put my worker on that bonus space and use that bonus (According to "in any order", I take the bonus first) as the 1 more dolloar that I'm lacked of?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, you can do that. That’s exactly the point of allowing you to do it in any order.

The point is that if you take the bonus you must carry out the action. In this example you may take the £1 before you build, but you may not take the £1 and then not build.

From thread: "Harvest question" - https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2451492/article/35151414#35...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Situation has arisen this evening with the winter visitor, Reaper: "Harvest up to 3 fields. If you harvest 3 fields, gain 2VP." Problem, after harvesting 2 fields all the spaces on the crush pad that the grapes from the third field could occupy are full, as are all the lower value spaces - so the grapes from the third field cannot be placed on the crush pad, even if they are devalued. Question:

(1) Can the third field be harvested and, although the grapes are lost, the 2VP are taken? Or,
(2) Can only two fields be harvested, the grapes remain in the third and no VP are scored?

The answer could determine who wins,
Steve
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The answer is number 2.

Reading between the lines of the quote from Jamey, if a field can't be stored then it can't be harvested
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 2866494:
Just wanna clarify this, make sure I understand it correctly. I'm playing on the expanded board. After the end of the year, which player gets to choose when to wake up first? And which player chooses afterwards? As I understand it: the 1st player on the wake-up chart chooses when to wake up next year first, and then remaining player clockwise? Or should it be "remaining players in order they've woken up current year"?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the Tuscany board, you choose wake-up position when you pass out of winter, not at the beginning of the year. Whoever passes first, chooses first.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That’s correct. The wake up chart merely indicates the order the players start in Spring. Each player chooses a wake up spot when passing out of winter and no one can choose first except the player that chose seventh spot and that player must take first in the new year. This is Tuscany Essential rules of course.

Hi - I have been playing on Board Game Arena and note the game allows you to devalue wines at will, reading the rules I understand this is not allowed. Can i just confirm this is poor implementation in the BGA version of the game as opposed to any misunderstanding on my part?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can devalue by necessity (e.g., if you make a value 3 wine token, but that slot is already full), but not by choice. It's possible that BGA allows it because that distinction is hard for the AI to differentiate.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I always considered that you can devalue wine or grapes whenever needed. Do you remember where this appears in the rules? ... indeed I always teach the rule stating that you put at the best slot available but did not realise that BGA allows for more flexibility
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the quick response, makes sense I guess that it's hard to implement, I'll now ask on their forum.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can think of only one instance where explicitly changing (downward) the value of a wine would make
any difference, that is in combination with the "Taster" blue card, where you would want to avoid a tie
value. Otherwise, it's always the same result if you just use the cheapest available wine for the wine
order or other sale.

Introducción
Viticulture es un juego de colocación de trabajadores y estrategia ambientado en la Toscana italiana en un mundo rural pre-moderno donde los jugadores tendrán que gestionar sus viñedos de la forma más eficiente, y para ello habrá que tirar de gestión económica, estrategia y mucha astucia. Desde plantar viñedos, hasta vender el vino al mejor comprador, pasando por recolectar la uva, envejecer el vino, embotellarlo y muchas otras tareas relacionadas con este mundillo.
Además, esta versión en concreto, la edición "Essential", contiene la segunda edición (cuya primera edición tiene a la crítica fascinada) más algunos elementos de la expansión "Tuscany", elegidos de la mano del mismísimo y legendario Uwe Rosenberg.

Análisis y conclusiones
El objetivo del juego es conseguir 20 puntos de victoria (que representan la reputación como propietario de viñedos) antes que el resto de jugadores. Existe una versión "automa" en la que juegas contra una IA desarrollada por Automa Factory y que te permite jugar en solitario, pero analizaremos principalmente la versión competitiva, que es la que más partido saca al juego.
El juego transcurre en rondas que representan cada una un año con sus cuatro estaciones, que serán las diferentes fases de cada ronda. En cada estación los jugadores tendrán que realizar una serie de tareas específicas de este periodo pero que están muy relacionadas entre sí. No hacer las tareas bien en primavera puede acarrear un mal año y perder la partida por una mala cosecha o por no llegar a embotellar bien el vino.
Cada jugador tendrá un color asignado, una serie de trabajadores y un tablero que representa sus viñedos. Además habrá un tablero central donde los jugadores interaccionarán para realizar diferentes tareas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comenzaremos con tres campos sin viñas y una bodega completa donde pisar la uva y almacenar el vino, así como con dos trabajadores estándar (y podremos contratar más adelante alguno más). Además tendremos unos "padres" (un Papa y una Mama) que nos darán ciertas ventajas aleatorias de salida en el primer turno de juego.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
La fases, que como hemos dicho son las estaciones de un año, comenzarán con la primavera, en la que elegiremos lo que madrugarán nuestros empelados en las siguientes fases. Esta elección luego tendrá sus consecuencias y deberemos elegir bien nuestra posición:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
En verano tendremos que elegir y ejecutar las acciones que queramos usando nuestros trabajadores. Entre ellas están comprar plantas de vid (robando cartas verdes), plantarlas (es otra acción diferente), o construir estructuras que nos darán ventajas y nos permitirán realizar acciones que de otro modo no podríamos (como plantar ciertos tipos de viña). Estas acciones son únicas de esta estación y nos prepararán para el otoño e invierno.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luego vendría el otoño, que básicamente se trata de jugar cartas de visitantes que hayamos robado o conseguido durante el resto de fases. Estos visitantes pueden ayudarnos en mayor o menor medida dependiendo de cada carta que nos toque.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Y por fín llegará el Invierno, en el que también podremos colocar trabajadores a realizar diferentes tareas como cosechar las uvas, hacer vino, contratar más jornaleros o, vender el vino (importante si queremos conseguir puntos de victoria).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Y así seguiremos con el juego hasta que algún jugador coseche 20 puntos de victoria, entonces ese año se considerará el último y todos los jugadores intentarán cerrarlo con éxito para alcanzar al que va en cabeza.
El juego es más completo que lo que acabamos de describir, pero a grandes rasgos es cómo funcionan los turnos y os haréis una idea de qué os vais a encontrar en una partida. En resúmen, se trata de un juego de colocación de trabajadores muy completo y con una selección de acciones que te van a hacer estrujarte los sesos para conseguir vender el vino. Ese vino es muy complicado de conseguir ya que para tener el vino que desean los compradores vas a tener que realizar tareas durante las estaciones previas y trabajar muy duro no solo el mismo años, sino con un proceso de plantación, mejora, cosecha que puede durar varios años. Sin duda una delicia de juego que te enamorará nada más jugar la primera partida. Y además si es la edición "Essential", viene aún más completa que el original, quedando un juego redondo.

Can I build the large sellar (for wines 7-9), without building the medium cellar?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No.

From the rulebook: "Note: The medium cellar must be built before a player builds the large cellar."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
thank you!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 2765436:
Can I do at the same season: first - harvest, and then uproot the same wine? (with Yoke and Summer Visitors cards?)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes you can. The vines are still there after you harvest grapes. So you can harvest and then uproot them in the same season (or even the same year).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
thank you!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How about this? You harvest field 1, uproot ALL vines on field 1 so that it is completely empty, plant vines in field 1 again, and then harvest field 1 again in the same year because the field was completely turned over. By completely wiping out all vines on the field, it's essentially a new field again.

How about this? You harvest field 1, uproot ALL vines on field 1 so that it is completely empty, sell field 1, buy field 1, plant vines in field 1 again, and then harvest field 1 again in the same year because the field was completely turned over, sold, bought, and planted again. Yes, this is possible.

Jamey might want to consider ruling on this as it is an edge case where it circumvents harvesting a field twice in one year.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Within the rules of the game, each field can be harvested only once per year. If you sell a field and then buy back that same field, it's still the same field.

I see what you're getting at, but the rules are clear. If it helps, imagine the soil needs to rest after harvesting grapes, uprooting, and then replanting all in one year.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You could do it, but what is the point of selling a field and then subsequently buying it back? You gain nothing. It seems like two wasted actions to me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Apart from the obvious critiques above, your biggest problem is that your actions cross seasons.
Harvest = winter
Uproot = summer
(Sell, rebuy = summer)
Plant = summer
Harvest = winter
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harvest with a yoke can be any season.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grape Thief... Visitors break the rules. If I'm using visitors to do all this... I can break the rules.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are plenty of Visitors that can easily allow it in base game. Adding Special Workers, Structures, and Tuscany board make it much easier.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can harvest at the yoke in spring, uproot with a yellow card, plant, then harvest again in the fall. I can even stretch my imagination that this might be sensible as part of a last-year sprint.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
possibly 2 victory points if you are 1st to take that action those 2 summer's

plus it's like an interest free loan
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
True, but 1 VP/action is (generally) not a good plan. Under some marginal circumstances,
such as in a "final year" situation, the +1 might be optimum. I usually take the orange
card rather than the VP. I've written elsewhere that the strategy of taking all the available
non-wine points is rarely successful.
Note that with the Mafioso special worker, you can get 2VP.

Hi fellow gamers,

I had one rule clarification question. Are you allowed to make a blush or sparkling wine from a set of grapes whose total value exceeds 9? For example could you use a 5 white and a 5 red grape to make a 9 blush. I always assumed you could not exceed a 9 when making theses combo wines but I just ready a comment by James Stegmaiar that made me question my understanding of that rule. Thanks for your input!

-Jonathan
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. They simply devalue to 9 when they go into the cellar.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Or whatever the highest available spot is.

Hilo ID 2625005:
After playing organizer, does that player immediately begin placing workers in the winter fields once it's they're turn again, or do they just pass until all other players finish summer placement?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When asking questions about cards, it’s always useful to quote the text on the cards, so that players who don’t have the game handy, can respond.

Actually, here’s an image from the rulebook:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The card lets you change order and do a normal pass. This means fall comes first for all players and then winter comes. Starting from fall (or from whatever season comes next, if you played this summer visitor in another season), you will use the new player order.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 2619897:
OK just started playing viticulture. Really like it but hate the fact that the booklet doesn't explain every visitor card like the wingspan book does for birds. So have a winter visitor card question if anyone knows the answer. The exporter says 'choose 1: make up to 2 in the cellar, fill 1 order, discard 1 in crush pad for 2 vp'. So bit im confused about, when it says make 2 in cellar, do you take a 2 from the crush pad and make it two in your cellar OR just make 2 in your cellar and not need to have anything in your crush pad OR move 2 up on any wine already in your cellar? Equally, it says you can fill one order. Does that mean I can fill an order for free or that I can fill an order but need the prerequisite wine in the cellar to do so?

Thanks everyone!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This will probably be moved/best in the Viticulture forums BUT more than happy to help.

The cards are essentially a way of doing other actions on the board sometimes with special abilities but more importantly without needing to send a worker to that space. So for instance the card you are talking about will allow you to essentially use the 'make wine tokens' or 'fill order' spaces without needing to put a worker there - maybe someone else has blocked it, or maybe you wanted to use the card for a better effect. However, you do just do the action as you would on the normal space - so making 2 wines in the cellar is moving them from your crush pad (making sure you don't go too far in your cellar unless you've bought the upgrades), and filling an order is just the same as going to the space on the board and you need to have an order card plus the required wines to fill it. Hopefully that makes sense, but essentially the card is just letting you do that action without going to its corresponding space!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 2602306:
Last night we had a visitor card (Jack of All Trades) that said something like “Choose 2 - harvest, make, fill”.

We couldn’t really decide if this allowed you to make wine with the grapes you harvested (or sell the wine you just made) with this card, or if you have to pick two actions before the grapes/wine “exist”.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can make wine with the grapes you harvest, or you can fill an order with the wine you make.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 12, visitor cards: “multiple actions on visitor cards may be taken in any order.”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is it allowed to make two actions of the same type i.e. harvest twice?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 2602113:
Hello fellow geeks!
I'm new to Viticulture and am wondering if the glass tokens should be placed on the planted fields automatically at yearend or if they need to be planted just as I'd plant a vine? Or some other unimagined possibility...
I don't see anything about this in the rules so have played a couple games assuming that I need to "plant" them to get the grapes back, but it just seems too hard to get anywhere this way... Can you help clarify for me pretty please?!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once vines are planted they are permanent. When you take the harvest action you then add the appropriate grapes (glass bead) to your crush pad. You may harvest each vine once per year.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To clarify further, you may harvest each field once per year. When you harvest a field you harvest all the vines on said field. If you plant a vine after you harvest a field (say if you have a Yoke and used it to harvest during the summer, then planted afterward), you can't harvest that vine since it's on a field that has already been harvested this year.

To make it easy to remember all this harvesting business, here's what we do:
- When you plant a vine, if it's the first vine of that color on that field and you haven't harvested that field yet this year, add a glass grape token to the field to represent unharvested grapes of that color.

- When you harvest a field you'll always have at most 2 grape tokens on any given field: 1 for red and 1 for white if you have both vine colors on the field, and only 1 token if you only have 1 vine color. To harvest, take all grape tokens off the field and put them on the corresponding red and white grape values on the crush pad based on the total red and total white values of vines on the field.

- During Year End upkeep, when aging grape and wine tokens, replenish the fields with the appropriate number of grape tokens, i.e. 1 grape token if 1 vine color, 2 grape tokens if 2 vine colors.

With this system it's clear that you're harvesting grape tokens and leaving the vines intact, and you'll always remember which fields you've already harvested for the year so you don't accidentally double-harvest a field.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This quote from near the end of page 7 in the rules.

Once a
vine is planted, it stays on the field for
the rest of the game, including when
the field is harvested. The only way to
remove a vine card is to use the Yoke or
a visitor card to uproot it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From page 10, near the start of the Harvest section, here is one sentence written in bold, along with an italicized note that follows it.

The vine cards remain on the field.

Note 1: Each field can only be harvested
once per year
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think the confusion here is that some players - including some who have made how-to-play videos! - put a glass token on each vine as they plant it, indicating it can be harvested. That's not technically part of the rules - it's just an easy reminder for some of us; when you harvest you'd move the glass token(s) from the field to the crush pad and then that would make it clear that you couldn't harvest that particular field again this year. If you choose to do this, then yes, at year end you'd replenish any fields with glass beads that need them. Hope that helps.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very clear! Thank you so much for this clarification

Are they the same thing or do you purchase each separately or 4$ each?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no cheese cellar in Viticulture. Perhaps you are thinking of
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes Tuscany, but that doesn’t answer my question.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It always helps to ask a question in the correct place. You are more likely to get an answer. However...
The medium WINE cellar is on the standard board.
The medium CHEESE cellar is on the Formaggio board.
They are different things that just happen to cost the same amount - 4 Lira each

I keep hearing good things about this but worker placement games are very much of a hit or miss in my gaming group. Games like Agricola that have a very limited number of worker placement positions and where a single misplaced worker can cause you to doomspiral don't tend to go over well.

On the other hand, Everdell is a favorite mostly because it's set up so that you are rarely put in a spot where you feel like you have no good options for placement.

This is a somewhat subjective question but where on the Agricola to Everdell scale does Viticulture sit?

Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In my opinion,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
is fairly well cemented on the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
side of that scale. This is true for the base game, but even more so when you get the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
expansion.

I will say, however, that I recommend playing with the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
visitor cards over the base visitor cards, or those from the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cards. Any of the visitor cards play well, but the way you tend to play the game seems more satisfying with the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
expansion.

Hope this helps.

I want to buy the base Viticulture for my lovely wife, but I'm confused on versioning. I need the most basic, non-expanded version of the game I can buy on the open marketplace today. Can someone point me to the correct version? If there's a bundle that comes with expansions that's fine, but I must have the base game included in that purchase. Thanks in advance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
is the current version of the base game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can read up about it here: https://stonemaiergames.com/games/viticulture/
What you want is Viticulture Essential Edition. This one is the official and currently best and also available version of the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Best is a weird word to me. I know Stonemaier uses it. It's like.....if it was the best version ever, you wouldn't need to claim that it was. You only say that because it isn't and you want people to think it is.

If you want to buy new, "only" is a much more accurate term. Its the only one you can still buy new. And its absolutely what the OP wants, and its absolutely fabulous.

But if someone was coming in and considering used games, I would rank Collectors Edition above Essential Edition. And I know there are people out there that would disagree ....by point is neither is really clearly "best".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OK, so I'm still a tad confused as to the versioning available - appears that Essential Edition is the only version of the base game generally available, correct?

That said, is this below an example of the complete Collector's Edition? And if so what's the difference between Essential and Collectors?

http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?type=4&cam...mVYAAOSwJ4Zfufyi
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thats it.

I'm a little annoyed to not find a super clean and comprehensive thread that covers all of the differences, but it is kind of a matrix of things so it might be hard to summarize.

- in Essential some rules are slightly changed
- CE includes original Tuscany which includes modules above and beyond what is in Tuscany : Essential Edition. All modules lost are not really all that popular anyway. Mamas and Papas started here, but was brought into Viticulture Essential Edition due to being universally regarded as great. There is an image on this page that discusses it https://stonemaiergames.com/games/viticulture/tuscany-essent...
- CE will require stickers to modify prices on property tiles. Those stickers may or may not be available anymore? Easy to fix yourself.
- CE has one misprinted structure card, the correction was made part of Moor Visitors mini expansion. The price was wrong, if I recall, but I'm nearly certain its an easy fix yourself.
- CE has the gorgeous double sided board (one side without text). It is gorgeous. Is it playable? Not really. The player boards without text are pretty playable though.

Based on what you describe above I will clarify and concur that Essential Edition is probably the product for you.

I suspect the answer to this is "yes," but I didn't see a clear answer, so I thought I'd go ahead and ask: Are both/either
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
and
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
compatible with the 2013 first edition of the game?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll give it a qualified "Yes"
I have V:EE and Tuscany original, and have no problems.

IIRC You won't have Mamas&Papas or the Grande worker, and I think a few of the Visitor cards were revised, but nothing to stop you simply playing with more visitors.

Hi, I´m looking for a story mode of Viticulture. Where you play multiple games with a backstory and different start criteria each game.
Saw this once somewhere within BGG, but can´t fint it.
Anyone know where I might find this?
Big thanks in advance!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are you thinking of

The solo version of the game has a campaign mode but I don't recall much of a story to it.

I just got a copy of the game and the first thing that called my atention was that the mamas and papas, owners of a wineyard in pre modern Tuscany, don't have mor even something that resembles italian names.

Can anyone please tell me If there's a logical explanation for that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They’re named after Kickstarter backers, influencers, and other similar worthies, if memory serves.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Back in the day, when I was working on Tuscany, I invited the then-small group of Stonemaier Ambassadors the chance to have their likeness incorporated into what would become mama and papa cards. I also included some friends and family. The names are those of the people who participated, hence why they're not Italian.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the reply. I tried to look it up but didn't find anything and thought of asking here if anyone could help. Great game btw

Having read & watched many reviews and posts on Viticulture & Tuscany, I’m eagerly awaiting my copy of Viticulture EE.

Should I buy Tuscany EE and plunge straight into the expansion modules before having even played Viticulture EE yet?

Your thoughts & opinions much appreciated
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a fan of the game, I can say emphatically: yes. Get Tuscany, and start with both. It is a much, much better game. And it all fits in the Viticulture EE box.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't think there's any need. The base game is really good, and you can take your time introducing expansion elements. It depends in part how complex a game you want as well - if you're happy jumping in the deep end there's no real harm starting with Tuscany, but you may find it all a bit much to keep track of if you try to use everything in your first game.

We played Viticulture 10 times before using any elements of Tuscany, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Then we introduced the larger Tuscany board, which does improve it. After 2 games with that we started introducing the special workers. Another 2 games later we haven't yet tried all of those or any of the structures.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just for the new season and board, I'd say yes. Those improve the game without making it more complex.

I'd only say wait if you think there's a good chance you won't like the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, you would be well served to start with the Tuscany board on the side without the extra cards and not using the extra expansions but the Tuscany board is just a better way to play the game. With that said regular Viticulture is a good game on its own. I am still happy to play the original version of the game without Tuscany, just never would if given the choice. I find the original game, to me, suffers at two without the bonus spaces being in play. With more players the frustration from the original as opposed to the Tuscany board is the difference in how turn order is handled. If you find you enjoy the game I also really like the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
expansion because I think it mitigates the swings the card play can take (though I don't really dislike those swings for a game of this weight anyway, especially in a game with a higher player count).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Viticulture EE is a nice game, but lacks the extra layer of interesting decisions that the extra season of Tuscany offers.

I now usually play 1 game of Viticulture to teach newbies and immediately move on to Tuscany.

That said, I would hold off on the special workers and buildings and buildings for a while. And we never use the promotion map (or whatever the stars thing is). I think it is a clunky fan-made add-on that detracts from the theme and flow of the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm gonna say: wait. Play the base game of Viticulture EE a few times to see if you like it, in a general sense. If you want something that ups the complexity but still feels like the same game, then by all means, get Tuscany EE.

I've played Viticulture over 25 times with just the base (EE) version, and only pulled out the extended Tuscany board 3 times - it requires a change in strategy and tactics, adds a handful more rules, and is harder to teach to new players (which is why if we have any new players, it's always the base game that's taught). I know many people say that once you play with the Tuscany extended board you'll not go back - but I disagree. I would *like* to play more with the extended board to get the hang of it (and then, eventually introduce structures and special workers, which we've not done as yet), but it requires playing the game with the same group a fair bit, which we've not had the chance to do in the last 7 months for obvious reasons.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I like both Viti EE and Tuscany EE. Plays great either way. This gives you options... As a fan, I prefer Tuscany. To introduce new players, I play Viti EE then after one or two, play Tuscany EE!!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Viticulture is ok but Tuscany improves it so much. Most expansions are a waste but this one makes it better.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuscany significantly reduces the potential of being screwed by unlucky card draws … If your first eight (say) vine draws do not include a red you have had it – and it's as bad (almost) if you don't get a white. In Tuscany there is a way round this.
Also there are cards that are provably worse than others (eg Papa cards that are identical except that one has an extra Lira)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is? How? I can't think of one.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can buy grapes in Tuscany
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<facepalm> Ah yes, of course! Thanks.

Not ideal, because you can only buy grapes of value 1, so you'll not be filling many orders that require red wines, but if you have good white grapes you can at least make blush and sparkling wines.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We got this game at Xmas, and have been playing it often, and so far don't feel any need to get
Tuscany. We also have Moor Visitors expansion cards, and I would recommend those!

Hilo ID 2451492:
My apologies if this is answered somewhere and I assume it is; however, I am having trouble finding the answer!

Can I take the harvest action if my crush pad is full? The example being, it is late in the game and I know my wife needs to harvest to fill her last order to have a chance to win the game. She used her Grande Worker earlier during the summer however. If my crush pad is full in all the spots where my harvested grapes could go can I still use the harvest action?

The logical answer seems to be yes. I can remove the grapes on the crush pad to make room for the new grapes seems to be one option. Or, there was no room so they were harvested and ultimately thrown out seems to be another.

Having said that, an argument can easily be made that if the pad is full, then I'm unable to complete the action. Therefore I can not use the space. Obviously, this is not as cut and dried as trying to 'block' the play summer/winter visitor card space while not having a visitor card. That is quite clearly not possible.

Thanks in advance for any help
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My feeling is that discarding grapes to make way for newly harvested grapes would not be allowed. I could see it being permissible to discard the newly harvested grapes though.

I do wonder if you are missing the rule that you can only harvest your fields once a year. The grapes age during the end of year process, so there is normally space at 1 level. That could have been filled by a visitor, but if you already used your yoke space to harvest, it is definitely not allowed to use the harvest action itself.

My feeling is, as long as you haven’t harvested this year, it would be permissible to harvest, and forfeit adding any new grape tokens.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, that's a good point about the ageing. More than likely there will be an empty space. I do know the rule about harvesting once a year; however, I was thinking of the 'block action' more in a vacuum. A what if this situation occurs late game and a block could save the win.

I think with ageing it is probably a very rare situation to be in. Still, if the crush was entirely full or maybe there is a way to add a grape(s) without harvesting via cards? I have just started exploring this wonderful game so I am not sure about adding grapes without harvesting.

Hopefully a definitive answer will be forthcoming. I think unless playing a 'friendly' game, this is a viable strategy, although knowing my wife it might not be a wise course of action
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just thought of a plausible situation. What if I have two fields with roughly the same low-level vines. Then I use my yoke action to harvest one field thereby filling my crush pad. Now the scenario I mention in my earlier post is plausible. It is my turn and I know that my wife/opponent needs to use the harvest action and let's assume that they do not possess their yoke building and have already used their grande worker this turn.

I have one field left to harvest; however, my crush has no room. We are back to the initial question of whether or not I can take a harvest action, thereby preventing my wife/opponent from doing so.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Within the harvest rules is the note about devaluing grapes (e.g., if you would normally gain a 3-value grape but there isn't a slot for it, you can devalue it to a 2-value grape. You're not removing existing grapes to make room for the new harvest. But the key point is that you are indeed harvesting a field to gain grapes that end up on your crush pad, so if you cannot legally gain any grapes from a harvest, then you can't take the harvest action. This is also consistent with the spirit of the game, which is that you can't block someone simply for the purpose of blocking them--that's why you're required to take the action whenever you place a worker.

So, Chris, in the situation you described, you are not allowed to place a worker on the harvest action.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Also, just to check...you’re also combining the values of all like-colored grapes in a single field into one grape, right? So if you have a field with a 2-red, 2-white, and 3-red, you’re only getting two grapes (5-red, 2-white). I’ve not played the game a ton, but it’s hard for me to imagine a situation where your crush pad is actually entirely full.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you so much for the response. My marriage thanks you too since I know this will eventually come up and my wife gets more than a little upset when I 'block' her actions in worker placement games

Also, since you are reading this, I'm sure you are inundated with praise for your games all the time. However, I wanted to let you know how much we are enjoying not only Viticulture, but also Wingspan. Which I know your company produced. Please pass my kudos along to the designer of that masterpiece as well. I think I have kickstarted/own all of the SM games and they are all top-notch. I still remember how jealous my fiends were when we received our copy of Scythe in the mail. We brought the game to our local gaming cafe and had people lining up to watch and play it.

While all of the games are great, I really enjoy Viticulture and Wingspan in particular. As someone who owns and plays a lot of games these two have really grabbed us. Thank you again for these wonderful games. They are a great escape, especially during this pandemic. I look forward to your future expansions and games.

Thanks for reading and take care.

Yeah, I was imagining a situation with several low-value grapes as stated earlier. Although, you may be right in the fact that the situation may be near impossible to have occur? I was watching a solo let's play this morning and the harvest action was blocked at the end of the game by the automa and it made me think of this situation. Again, it was in a vacuum at first and maybe it's near impossible to actually occur in a real game?

Regardless, I'm glad that the designer has clarified the rule so there is no question now. It was really bugging me!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Chris! I appreciate your kind words, and I'm glad you enjoy the escape of Viticulture and Wingspan.

--
When I first talked about Viticulture, I gave a flippant Mini review:

Viticulture – it passes the initial Kickstarter game test – in that we have played it once and no one complained that it sucked, which has been the case with more than half of the KS games that have landed on the gaming table. Still needs another play prior to writing a review. The boys want to play it, so maybe I’ll get a different view of it when playing with them as opposed to the gamers.
I wasn’t sure how others would take this – but the one of the designers later commented “I will fully accept, “It didn’t suck” as a review of Viticulture. (But I’m looking forward to a full review as well–thanks Dale!)”



So, I’ve played the game twice more, and now I’m ready to say what I think about the game…

Quick Game Mechanic Overview:

Viticulture is a worker-placement game. It is played over a number of rounds until someone has scored at least 20 points. At the end of that round, the player with the most points wins. Each player has his own mat which shows his vineyard. There are areas for planting vines, for storing grapes, for aging wines, etc. There are also a number of structures on your vineyard which help you be more efficient in your actions.

The main board has two main areas – a summer area and a winter area. Each section of the board has different action spaces, but more on that later. There are also 4 different decks of cards used in the game: vine cards, order cards, summer visitor cards, winter visitor cards. Each round equals a year, and each of the four seasons is played in turn… until someone has at least 20 points at the end of a year.

SPRING: this is essentially turn order determination. There is actually a start player marker that rotates around with each year, but it pretty much only decides who gets to play in Spring first. In this first phase, players take turns placing their rooster token on any of the 7 turn order slots. The later you end up in turn order, the better sort of bonus you will get that year. For instance, if you choose to go first in order, you get no bonus. If you choose position #6 (out of 7), you automatically score 1VP – which is 5% of the total VP you need to win the game! Once all players have chosen a unique spot on the chart, the turn order for the rest of the year follows that chart.

SUMMER: In summer, you get to place some/all of your workers to do summer specific actions:

Draw a vine card: add a vine card to your hand
Plant vines: this is how you get vine cards out of your hand and onto the fields on your player mat
Build structures: spend gold and build things which make your actions better (i.e. build structures cheaper, get more money for giving yours, draw more cards when you draw, etc)
Give a Tour: essentially, get gold from bank
Sell Grapes: Though you normally want to make wine, sometimes you need to sell your grapes to get a bit of cash
Play a Summer Visitor Card: Visitor cards have special actions/abilities on them which generally break the standard rules of the game
It should be noted that each action has 1 (in 2p), 2 (in 3-4p), or 3 (in 5-6p) action spaces available – each can only be occupied by a single worker. If you are playing with at least 3p, one of the available action spaces gives you a bonus for taking that action – such as drawing an extra card, or gaining one extra gold when you tour, or paying one less gold when you build a structure.

FALL: not much goes on here – players get to add a visitor card to their hand. They choose whether it is a Summer or a Winter Visitor card

WINTER: you get to place the rest of your workers in this phase (the ones you did not play in Summer). The actions are different here, so you have to decide when in the year you need your workers to work.

Draw an Order Card – get an order card from the deck
Harvest Field – this is how you get grapes from your vineyard
Crush Grapes – you convert already harvested grapes and turn them into wine. The better the quality of grapes you use here, the better the starting quality of the wine you produce.
Fulfill a Wine Order – trade in wines of type/quality specified on the card and receive between 2-6 VPs
Train a Worker – get an extra worker for use in later rounds of the game
YEAR END (Upkeep) – in between winter and spring, you clean up your area. All grapes and wines age – each moves to the next most valuable space on the chart – as long as you have space for them and capacity to hold that sort of wine. All players discard down to 7 cards in their hand (between all 4 types) and the start player token moves clockwise. Unless, of course, someone has at least 20 points. If so, the player with the most points wins. In a weird twist, you cannot score more than 25 points, so it is possible that two players could tie at 25, even though both scored more than that, and then go to the tiebreaker to determine the winner.

The whole wine production is a multi-step process, and it takes a play or two to really get into the flow of this process. The steps needed are:

Get vine card(s) – done in summer phase
Plant vines – summer
Harvest field – winter
Crush Grapes – winter – this is a complicated sub-step. Here, you might only use white grapes to make white wine, only red grapes to make red wine, one red and one white to make a blush or 2 red and one white to make a sparkling wine…
Age wine – year end
Draw an order card – winter
Fulfill an order card – winter
MY THOUGHTS ON THE GAME:

Viticulture is subtitled “the Strategic Game of Winemaking”, and I must admit that the theme is strong in the game. As you progress through this worker-placement game, you do often get the feeling that you’re toiling away in Tuscany making tasty bottles of wine. And, like I said in my first flippant review, “it doesn’t suck”. After 4 plays, I can confirm that it doesn’t suck, but it also didn’t get any better. It is a solid first design from both the designers and publisher, but there are a few areas that hold it back from being a great game.

As far as worker placement games go, Viticulture has a number of things going for it. I do like the turn-order choosing phase. Each player gets his turn to choose first for order, but there are some definite worthwhile bonuses that may make you choose later. I like this initial choice as both your turn order location as well as your bonus can really determine how your year goes. It’s not an entirely new mechanic – it has been used recently in Fresco and Last Will – but it fits in nicely here.

I also like the split of actions – it can be a difficult choice to choose when to use your workers. Most worker placement games allow you to use all your workers each year. In Viticulture, you have the added level of complexity of having to split your workers up amongst two completely distinct placement areas. The actions are all valuable, and it is crucial to make sure that you get the actions when you need them or else you’ll have to wait an entire game year to get an opportunity to do that action again… and this will slow down your entire wine producing engine for a year. The bonuses available for each particular action also add a nice bit of tension to the game because it creates some racing to each action in order to get the bonus.

Where the game falls apart for me is with the visitor cards. They are meant to add a bit of spice to the game as they are somewhat unpredictable and can allow for great swings in fortune. For me, they are too varied and not overly balanced. These visitor cards are essentially distributed at random – you get one to start the game, one in each Fall phase, and then you can place a worker on the summer or winter Draw a Worker card space to get them.

For example, in the summer cards, you might randomly draw the Architect which allows you to build a structure at a 3 gold discount. Now, 3 gold is nothing to sneeze at in this game, and the Architect does save you from having to fight for a build structure worker space (well, it just shifts it because instead you have to fight for a play-a-summer-visitor-card space instead). But… what if you had the Horticulturist, a card which allows you to uproot 1 vine card and discard it for VPs equal to the grape value of that card (as much as 4VP). Trust me, 4VP is worth many times more than 3 gold in this game. Heck, it’s 20% – TWENTY PERCENT – A FULL ONE-FIFTH! – of what you need to win the game. In a single card that you happened to draw randomly. The winter cards have similar weak and strong cards.

Now, I can see the argument that the draw a worker card space is open to everyone, and if you really want to get one, you can choose to go first in turn order to guarantee that you can choose them… but the variability is so high, it just never seems worth it unless you’re doing the equivalent of Grand Tichu in the last round of the game because you have no other viable choice. It would be madness to put all you eggs in the worker card basket early in the game… yes, you might get a card that essentially allows you to score 3 or 4 VP – which is huge in a race to 20… but you might also draw a card which essentially gives you 2 gold.

Some of the worker cards also seem to give you powers that are so strong that they take the place of 3 or 4 regular actions. These cards also seem overpowered a bit and detract from the engine building nature of the game. If this were a 30 minute game, that might be fine. But it leaves a sour taste in your mouth to lose a 2 hour long game just because I was lucky enough to draw an inhumanely good card in the last round on a random whim.

Overall, it’s a solid game, and I’m glad to have had a chance to try it. The production quality is of a high level, the cards have a nice finish to them, there are plenty of custom wood bits and the board/box has decent to above average art. There are many good ideas in the game itself and all of the concepts work as advertised. But, I’ve yet to have a game in 4 tries that all the players were satisfied with – mostly due to someone either getting all the good worker cards or one player getting only crappy ones and essentially being disqualified from the game as a result. With some tweaking of the cards this could be a great game, but the released version falls short of that goal. Like the wines in the game, this one could have used a few more turns of aging/developing to become a more refined and better product.

So, with the family spread over the countryside and everyone possessing their own game, I wondered: How can we play remotely, at a distance?

Setting up Zoom/Skype or any video conferencing would work: Getting everyone to visually sync with the board is, perhaps, the easy part.

It's the card draws that I wondered about. Would the following work?

Example: You would draw a Summer card, either from your starting position or from the board space. Having one central board, a person there pulls the top Summer card, everyone looks away except you, and the person holds the card up to the camera: You pull that card from your Summer deck. The person at the central board sets that card aside face-down.

When you play that Summer card in another play/year, everyone pulls that card from their Summer deck, and discards it: As you would do in F2F play.

Otherwise, I suspect the play could proceed as usual. I might be forgetting something...

Suggestions? Questions? Modifications? Thanks!

Play on Boardspace.net while you skype.

Years ago I remember reading a lengthy thread that listed all of the Viticulture products and explained what the essential versions added or left out. Does anyone happen to know where that thread is? I've searched but found nothing.

I'm trying to figure out which modules were removed from the base game.

Ask stonemaiergames.com. They are good about responding.

hi Yall
we love Viticulture. normally play wiht 4 or 5 but now the GF and I are quarantined and playing 2 person.

i was surprised teh rules dont want to give a bonus to person who first takes a station (e.g. plant) and that only 1 person can play each station. I guess the designer thinks its too much of an advantage?

anyway... anybody have any suggestions to make 2 player game more interesting.

for example. with 2 people the wake up order mechanism loses some of its cool trade-offs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You’re interpreting this correctly.

When teaching new players I give them a boost of starting with a vine card that has one red/one white. You could do something similar where you agree to to one additional starting vine or an order. However, I believe opening the bonus space throughout the game does give too much of an advantage.

Second thought, open the space but then use the solo deck as a third player and pre-emptively block those bonus spaces when the Automa indicates.

My hubby wants to place his worker on that
+1 space Make up to two wine tokens. He does not have any grapes to make any wine, he wants to block that spot so I can't play on it. His reasoning: its says "make up to", so you could make zero!! LOL. What a competitor!!
Thanks so much
Grammie1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The rules do say
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No hate blocking in Viticulture. Don't place a worker unless you can take the action. The +1 lira space is always available, so there's always something productive that you can do.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 2384467:
Can you do all these actions in 1 year (assuming of course good combo of red, white and order card)? Or does there need to be time in between?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, provided you can sequence the actions correctly. There is no requirement for wine to remain in your cellar for any length of time
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It’s possible. I’ve never completed all that in the first year, usually sometime in the game it aligns and all the spaces are available despite the Automa.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no restriction against it declared in the rules.

Hi, sorry if this is rehashing old ground.
I've got a 1st edition copy and looking to get the 2nd edition to EE upgrade pack. If I also get the Tuscany Essential expansion, what else apart from the Grande meeple would I be missing? Are any of the cards in the 1st -> 2nd edition upgrade included/superseded with the Tuscany Essential expansion?

I'm not that bothered by missing the modules from the original Tuscany.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I had the original 1st Edition Kickstarter version with all the stretch goal stuff and Arboriculture etc.

I have now upgraded it to EE by getting the various modules, new cards, stickers, tiles etc. To be honest, I wish I'd just left it alone and stayed with the original version as it was. It wasn't worth the effort. That's my feeling.

The updated visitor cards are more useful/flexible, but also more complex to understand. Usually they have options for what you can do with them.

The mammas and the pappas don't really add much.

I do like the fields you can mortgage to get some cash.

I prefer the old wine making rules where you can make as many wines as you like of one type. Instead of two wines of any type.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 2346021:
The Edition to define all Editions. Oh boy, let your imagination run wild...recessed player boards, neoprene mat, poker sized cards, coins, miniatures. This game deserves the royal-red-carpet roll-out. Seriously, I want a Lacerta style BB for this one. (No, the art is fine, lets not bring in Ian O'Toole...love his work but lets stop already.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would love a mat with the Tuscany expansion (maybe 2 sided - one with the standard board and one with Tuscany).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would recommend the little doll wine bottles that match each player color for the score, they look really sweet.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I really love Viticulture and this sounds awesome, but I don't think I would take the time to sell my copy just to acquire a master edition of this game. This would be great for people who don't already own the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 2294014:
Hey i bought a used copy on Vitticulture. Turn out i recived the first printing, kickstarter edion of the game.

It contains a lot of cool extra stuff but also som super annoying issues. From my understanding

Rulebook is out of date
Gameboard is out of date
Many cards are out of date

Wondering what to do. i see there is an upgrade pack, but it´s only from 2.nd printing to essential.

Anyone know what would be the best and most easy solution.
I just want a straight up, playable up to date version.

Thanks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You could just play the edition you've got. It's fine. It's the edition I have and it's a great game. None of the upgrades are essential. The first ed kickstarter had the Grande meeples which is the main thing people recommend.

There's an upgrade pack too which you might be able to get. But it's a bit fiddly, you have to go through all the cards and figure out which ones to replace, there are several versions. This is what I did in the end. But it makes many of the cards more complex as they are now either/or. Which means they are more useful too and less situational.

I have an opportunity to buy Viticulture and the Tuscany Expansion. Should I buy this or should I just but Viticulture Essential Edition?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Viticulture + Tuscany gives you more game than just Viticulture Essential. It has more even if you include Tuscany Essential in your Essential purchase.

Some Caveats:
Essential is better thought out.
Essential (V+T) is cheaper than the original editions.
The general consensus is that the bits missing from V+T:EE are not really worth having anyway. Though there seems to be a thriving PnP trade in them which appears to give the lie to this statement.

There are a number of errata-ed cards in the original. There was an update pack available. Not sure if it still is.

If you are lucky (I was!) the Tuscany set may be the KS edition with the metal coins.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+1 to everything Greg said.

Unless it's cheaper than buying both the Essential Editions (Viticulture + Tuscany), or unless you're a super completionist, it's probably better to go for the latest printings.

If you do like the game, grab the mini expansions Moor Visitors and Visit from the Rhine Valley. I'd prefer these over the PnP modules that were dropped from Tuscany Essential.

This one has been a long time coming as I was really keen to fit all the commonly used bits from
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(that's the original with all the things, not the essential edition) as well as the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
expansion into a single box.

As I was beginning to put it together I offhandedly said to my wife "It's a pity I won't be able to fit everything in; we probably won't play the parts I leave out once this is finished".
"What do you mean "leave out"?"
"There's no way I'll be able to fit everything in, the box isn't big enough."
And then, with a slight smirk and a raised eyebrow, she said something that changed the entire point of the build: "I bet you can't make it all fit."

And so, dear reader, I present you with the insert I'm branding as: LOOK, KATHERYN WAS WRONG! AKA Wow, my wife really knows how to motivate me
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The fully loaded insert. This picture is just here to show that yes, both the original and expansion board and both manuals fit in the box flush with the top.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boards and manuals removed. The compartments along the bottom take advantage of the fact that the vineyard and structure player boards are not the full width of the box. This allows me to make use of a small volume of extra space to hold the larger cards. From left to right these compartments hold: Property tiles and Automa cards; Glass beads (in a removable box for easy dumping); Mama and Papa, Patronage, Mafia and Special worker cards. There is enough room in this compartment for the promo special worker cards if they ever find their way into my collection. You may also notice a length of ribbon draped over the boards. This allows me to lift them out without having to jam my hand down the side of the box. It works so well (I can't believe I haven't thought of it before) and I'll be using it in a lot of future designs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vineyard and structure boards removed. All the small cards fit along the right-hand side in order of how they are placed on the board. Top to bottom: Vine, Summer visitor, Wine order, Winter visitor, Structure and Special (Arbour and "Super secret" Structure). Below that is another removable box which holds the cows (for Arboriculture) and the special worker meeples. It is here that I have made my one concession: I have only included 2 of each colour special meeples, not the 11 which came in the expansion. This is functionally the same as you only ever use two of the cards at a time and is actually what the essential edition of Tuscany contains. The Formaggio/Arboriculture boards also require the ribbon in order to retrieve them from the box.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Formaggio/Arboriculture boards removed. This compartment contains 3 removable trays, two of which hold three sets of player pieces each, the other contains the coins, grape and extra worker meeples, and Morale and Cheese Cellar markers. If I ever obtain the metal coins for this game I will just lop off the coin end of the middle tray and have the metal coins in a small draw string bag in the resulting space.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The whole kit and kaboodle! When it's laid out like this I can scarcely believe I fit it in myself. My four-year-old son was watching me set up the game the other day, pointed to the box and said: "It's like a TARDIS!" I have to agree.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazing work!

... will you be able to fit in Visit from the Rhine Valley, though?

Viticulture, with Tuscany expansions, is going to be on Boardspace.net.

The implementation has reached the point where some human play
can help find the last few bugs, and your suggestions can help
fine-tune the user interface.

The implementation supports 1-6 players (1 player with automa)
and includes structure cards and special workers.

Hello, I played the game a few times and I really dislike the randomness of the cards. You can't make a good strategy because of this. I came with an idea - instead of drawing the top card to have open cards of every type.

At the beginning of the game above the board make a row of 4 cards of every card type. Whenever you draw a card you can take cards from the row or from the face down deck. Whenever you take a card replenish the row.

Let me know what do you think.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Vladimir, I see your point but we felt the only real thematic impact of the randomness of the cards was with the wine order cards. For these, similarily to your house rule, we make a display of three cards and you can take one of those or the top card of the face down deck. It just seemed strange to run a wine business and not have some control over the orders you would be fulfilling.

For the visitor cards, we see these as random encounters with folk who visit and can help your business. We don't have an issue with playing with the rules as is.

You can always try the small additional expansion decks of cards that are available. These are more tuned to wine making than the original deck of visitors. We have still to try out visitors from the Rhine valley though.

Enjoy the game

Hey you guys, I'm the one who was so excited the other day to be getting Viticulture. I played a game two-handed on my own as a run through, and we've played it three more times since then. It's set up to play tonight when hubby gets home. I've already ordered Visitors from the Rhine Valley, which we both felt we would prefer as it keeps the focus on winemaking and avoids what amount, to us, to cheap points grabs (I know opinions vary). It's on the table for a first play tonight. I went for it and ordered the upgrade coins today, and hubby will be ordering Tuscany EE. We're hooked.

We've been calling it Wine-cordia, Con-viti-a, and even Castles of Wine-gundy, because it seems to slot in so nicely with two favourites of ours, Concordia and Castles of Burgundy. Heresy?

Even though they're not really alike, I was considering a toss up between Wingspan and Viticulture. I'm glad I chose Viti!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I really like what this expansion adds. The new board and the special meeples in particular. I think you'll like it!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't have Wingspan (yet!) so I cannot be certain, but I suspect you would have been happy going down either path.

But very glad you like Viti so much. I am sure you will love Tuscany even more. On my end, I really must look into Concordia. COB is out because of colourblindness issues.

So glad you're having fun with it!

Hey guys,

Sorry these have probably been answered but I'm not very good at finding old posts.

Playing solo (extended board), can you use a glass token to use the bonus position or only gain the bonus from that position if there is one? ie when use the gain card action in spring Can I use a token to repeat the action meaning I would get 2 cards?

Thanks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm not sure whether I'm reading the question correctly, so let me know if the below doesn't answer your question.

You can only use a glass token on an action where you place worker and it must be in the turn where you place that worker.

The glass token doesn't give you the benefit of the space itself, instead it gives you the benefit of a bonus on that action, which you didn't already get from the worker placement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Morten,

Yes you did answer my question!

I find the solo very difficult but enjoy it none the less!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm happy to hear that you're enjoying it .

There are variants to lower the difficulty level.

Lowering the difficulty never interests me, it's all about how I can do better! Loving the wingspan automa too btw!

I ask because I ordered the Folded Space insert that says it’s for the Essential Edition (and holds the various card expansions, too) and now wonder if it’ll fit in my 2014 base game box. Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't KNOW so, but I think you are pretty safe.

I have Viticulture Essentials and Tuscany Original (the KS edition) and the boxes are identical in size. I expect that Tuscany Original would have been the same size as Viticulture Original. Though I know T:EE is different.

Original Tuscany and original Viticulture have the same size box, so you should be fine.

When I harvest 2 fields, do I :

1/ add the total value of all red grape icons of both fields to create 1 red grape token or

2/ add separately for each field the total value of all red grape icons to create 2 red grape tokens ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is correct.

+1

Each field produces one grape token of each colour planted. So one Red; or one White; or one Red and one White.

I now have it penciled in to be played in the next few weeks.

My question is: should I buy Tuscany and incorporate that into my very first game? Or is playing with the base game still really good? It's just I always see Viticulture and Tuscany named together in recommendations.

Thanks for any help.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You should buy Tuscany and incorporate it! It is an amazing expansion!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's much better with Tuscany
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is certainly better with Tuscany, but what level of games are you normally playing? If no one in your group has played Viticulture with Tuscany whatsoever, go ahead and play the base game several times first to get some enjoyment of it first. The base game is still enjoyable, but most people do not want to go back after playing Tuscany. This is usually the case with expansions in most games anyway.

I still go back and play the base game when time is short, or if I'm teaching people that are used to playing light to medium games.

Could I use the Manager card to duplicate an already taken Yoke action?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don’t see why not, it’s certainly no more powerful than using Manager to trigger the regular fall harvest action. I’d allow it at my table
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't have the card in front of me, but if it refers to an action "on the board," you can only take actions on the game board (not the Yoke). Same if it refers to an action in a specific season (or a past, present, or future season). Otherwise, yes, it could apply to the Yoke.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That’s a no then. That makes a lot of sense on reflection, otherwise it would allow doubling up the Structure spaces.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"otherwise it would allow doubling up the Structure spaces"

Not sure what you mean here.

This thread is an interesting one for precision. What if I play my yoke in summer? It does qualify as 'previous season' no?


Maybe because the yoke is not 'from a previous season' (since it can be played any season) it's a no?

For me it seems legit to be able to replay the yoke. Why would it be prevented?

Very close, almost was the architect of my own defeat, but held on by 1 point. Also, lucked out with a bit of a hail Mary at the end, but I only had to do that because of a previous error. My Momma / Poppa cards allowed me to start with 2 Green cards, a blue card, and the Wine Tasting room.

Strategy :
- I took the victory point at every opportunity. That meant in a 4-player game, I was almost always last.
- I built only 1 worker in year 2. Played the whole game with 4.
- I sold 2 fields, both with the Victory point.
- My starting green cards were 3 white and 1 red. I never planted anything else, never hunted for other vines, and both were planted on the same field.
- I only took Blue visitor cards.
- I built the minimum buildings possible. Irrigation because one vine required it, Medium and Large Cellars because my first Wine card was for 7 points and required a blush. No cottage, trellis, yolk, or windmill.
- On the last turn, I took First Place rather than a Victory point. This allowed me to get on Wine Tour first for 1VP (Tasting Room), and then get on play 2 Blue cards in the fall first. I played a 2VP based on the number of workers my opponents had and a second one which allowed me to fill an order for an extra VP (5+1). That got me to 24 points.
- One player was able to play a 4-point blue card, and then fill a very large order, pushing him to 26. I had 2 workers left, but quite a bit of wine in my cellars. No one had taken the Take 2 Purple cards, so I took it, and got lucky as I was able to fill one for 3 VP. I used my large worker to fill it for 27.

The mistake. I had 6 coins I was going to use to build my large cellar. Had I done so that turn, my wine would have aged to 7 by the next year, and I could have filled my big order one year earlier. Instead, I had a visitor card which allowed me to gain 3VP by giving each player 2 coins. Because I chose to do that, I lost the opportunity to fill that big order as I had to wait another year before I could build the Large Cellar. I would have ended with 23, but the second place player would not have been able to have his last round where he got 10 points.

Did not see anything on the forums but Meeplesource has upgraded meeples for both Viticulture and tuscany on kickstarter right now. [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/meeplesource/painted-ch...]

We have viticulture second edition. End the argument between my wife and I. Should we be using the updated essential edition rules ie. the no maximum vitory points and you must have wine in your cellar in order to get vitory points with the tasting room?

Or should we be using the 2nd edition rule book.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm pretty sure both are applicable, but I see no reason why can't you use the newest rules of EE.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's not worth arguing over a game. That should end it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have updated to EE.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I strongly suggest using the EE rules. They "fix" some elements that, at least in my opinion, could use the fix.

For example, pre-EE one winning strategy was to ignore wine and just focus on abusing the tasting room since, with upgrades, it was more-than-competitive and almost-unstoppable. Since Viticulture is a game about making wine, this defeated the overall purpose of the game and it wholly ignored significant aspects of the game. The EE rules balance this out by slowing it down just enough (by the wine requirement) such that it is no longer an unstoppable strategy. It's much more balanced.

The EE rule changes are there for a reason. I urge you to use them.

Problem solved we bought the EE upgrade pack.

I own Viticulture 2.0 (non-EE) and Tuscany EE

Do I need the Moore Visitors and Rhine Valley expansions?

Do I need to buy the EE Upgrade pack?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Need? No.
Want? Probably.

If memory of the various versions serves me right, with that setup, you will be missing the Mama and Papas which is an alternate randomised set up system to the fixed system you have.

You will also be missing the Automa which may or may not matter to you. You only need it for solo play

Sellable fields are also missing. Some of the Tuscany EE spaces will make no sense without them. Some of the visitor cards also reference them.

You may not have all the revised visitor cards that came with V:EE. Not sure if they appeared in Version 2 or not.

The two expansions will add to play regardless. But they are "want" not "need".

The EE Upgrade will normalise your set.


Oddly, I have the reverse to you. I have V:EE and original Tuscany

Hilo ID 2016093:
I bought a used copy of Viticulture what seems to be the 1st edition of the game without Grande Workers ... Now I saw there used to be an upgrade pack for this version to 2nd edition incl the GW but it seems that you can no longer get it?

Is there any way to still update my game without buying a more recent edition?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes! Go to Stonemaier website, they have the upgrade pack for about $10, I think
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That is the upgrade pack for Viticulture 2nd ed. to EE. Can't see the other upgrade pack.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's all the differences between the first and second editions.

Here's the differences between 2nd edition and essential edition.

Here's the upgrade pack to go from 2nd ed to essential ed.

Here's a place to buy 24mm meeples that are the same size as the Grande workers. Jamey says on the 2nd ed. page that the colors are almost a perfect match.

I think that by buying the large meeples and the upgrade pack, and replacing all the visitor cards with the ones from the upgrade pack, and using the essential edition rules, that you'll at that point have Viticulture: Essential Edition.

Edit: you can also paint 1 meeple of each color and use it as the grande, or use meeples from another game, or pretty much anything you want that would differentiate them. One person recommended tying ribbons around their necks for scarves.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I may have a complete second set on cards. Send me a personal note if interested; I can check tomorrow.

No charge.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's true that we ran out of stock of first-edition upgrades a while ago, though if you can't find what you need elsewhere, just e-mail me and I can sell you the following:

6 grande workers (unless your first edition has them)
6 vineyard mats (not necessary, but the updated versions help)
1 Viticulture Essential game board
50 glass tokens (smaller size for better fit)
1 Viticulture Essential Edition rulebook (you can also print this from our website)

Absolutely loving the game but there a few visitor cards that have 2 "OR" actions and then say "You may lose 1 to do both" and I'm not sure how to interpret them.

The Sponsor card, for example, says you can draw 2 vine cards OR gain 2 lira and then says you may lose 1 VP to do both.

Does this mean you can either draw a vine card OR gain 2 lira and it will cost you 1 VP in either case?

OR

Does it mean that you can do either of the actions for free but you can do also do both, but it will cost you the 1 VP?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basically, you have three options:

1. Draw 2 vine cards.
2. Gain $2.
3. Lose 1 VP. Then draw 2 vine cards and gain $2.

My wife and I love Viticulture (Tuscany) ... the only thing we don't like is that the little glass beads are easy to accidentally nudge and slide around.

Anyone else feel that way? Anyone come up with different components that work with the feel and look of the game?

Thanks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Giant board with full bottles of red and white wine to mark the aging.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How about a thin layer of clear silicone on the bottom of the beads? that should give them a little traction.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think anything might slide if the board is nudged, even red and white wooden cubes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Combining two of the ideas above...
Why not try gluing red and white felt to the bottom of the beads.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How curious. In other games there are owners who would specifically buy tokens like this as an accessory to replace those supplied by the publisher.

I'd just like to start off by saying my wife and I love this game. It's currently one of our favorite games to play together. The components are also amazing. I got Tuscany EE and even the metal coins. Those metal coins are amazing.

My only problem with the game is the player boards. Graphically they are beautiful and functional. The field cards are a bit problematic but we either just place them above their spots on the table or tuck them underneath the board only pulling them out when we need to sell a field. So that's workable. The big issue is it's way too easy to bump and knock the boards around upsetting the components on top. I had the same issue with Eclipse and to an extent Arkham Horror. Viticulture's board is slightly more susceptible to this because it seems like they warp a bit in storage and I need to remember to back bend them before we play or they will easily spin around when bumped.

If Stonemaier Games put out some sort of luxury player board I'd gladly purchase that product since this game has legs. I can see it being in our rotation for years.

Does anyone else have a similar issue with the player boards? If so has anyone found a way to fix this issue? I know for Eclipse and Arkham Horror this was fixed with a third party plastic tray that had spots for tokens to slot into and thus not slide around when bumped.

Edit: I noticed that I posted this in the original Viticulture forum and really it's an issue with Viticulture EE. I will post this issue there.

Just want to make sure I have this right before I get the game to the table.

When you fill an order you move up the corresponding number of payments on the residual payment track. Once you get payed you keep your token on that level so even if you don't fill an order the next year you still get that amount of residual payment.

So basically you do not reset your residual payments to 0 every year.

That's correct, and the track maxes out at 5.

I already got Scythe metal coins so is buying the Viticulture coins an overkill?

I heard they are nice but do not stack well. Can Scythe coins be used instead? Of course the theme is lost then.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the point of view of tracking how much money you have, who cares what tokens are used? Seriously, it doesn't matter! However, from an aesthetics point of view it may matter to some people. Let me 'fess up and say that I own three sets of Viticulture coins and two full sets (including Promo values) of Scythe coins. Viticulture coins are used for Viticulture and Concordia, the Scythe coins are my "generic" coins. I couldn't care less whether the coins stack or not (I seldom have enough that it's an issue )
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's true that they don't stack well, but they have a really nice heft and texture to them. I almost prefer to have these particular coins in a heaping pile than a neat stack.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Scythe coins do a fine job, I use them for all sorts of games like Voyages of Marco Polo but even though the Viticulture coins don't stack at all they are very pretty and I bought an extra set to
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heh, I use the Viticulture coins for Marco Polo. I figure they're Lira, and Marco Polo was Italian, so...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I hadn't considered using those in my other games, nor swapping. I'm thematically motivated. Good idea though ... but like another poster, I'd need more sets to cover Concordia. Think I'll leave mine as game specific.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I bought two sets of the Viticulture coins and use them for all sorts of games (Gloomhaven, Spartacus, Vinhos for example). As long as you don't need huge amounts (like ~50 money per player or something like that), they are great.
I prefer them to the Scythe coins, which are smaller.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I also have Concordia, and didnt think to use those coins for that game too lol. Guess Ill try it out and see what the players think.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I find myself agreeing with all those points Jamey. I also think they have a good "sound" (better than the Scythe coins) as well as a good feel in the hand.

I got the Viticulture coins they are great. how are Clans of Caledonia: Coin Sets?

What is the complexity of Viticulture comparable to? My wife is my primary gaming partner; she will play things like Catan, TTR, Flamme Rouge and Carc, is Viticulture in that ballpark? I'm learning that games that I can't play with my wife will never get played so there's no point in buying them. This one seems really interesting to me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mid weight.
My wife generally does not like complex games. Transforming Mars is the heaviest game she has taken to.
She enjoys Viticulture.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Jeff says, it's a mid-weight worker placement game. There's a lot to get your head around in the first game, but it's mostly pretty thematic, which helps.

Have you played any light weight worker placement games? The generally recommended ones (which I agree with) are Lords of Waterdeep and Stone Age. Viticulture is a small step up from these, but it's not that much more complex.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I’d describe it as a touch heavier than Alien Frontiers (but much less mean) and a bit lighter than Agricola (but much more forgiving)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It should only take one play to get your head around the extra complexity in Viticulture over TtR. Yes it is a step up. But not a big one. In fact I would put it as slightly less complex than TtR:UK if you have played that variant.

As already mentioned the complexity drives the theme so it is all pretty easy to remember.
If oyu wake up early you get more done.
You plant in the beginning of the year. Harvest at the end and so on.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'd echo the comment about exposure to worker placements and the logical ease of this game.

As a new gamer, Lords of Waterdeep took me a while to grasp. But mainly its theme got in my way. Viticulture had a theme I understood: plant in spring, harvest in fall, then make wine and store/age it in the cellar. If you play the first game as a straight path, earning points by filling orders, then it's easier to see the MAIN PATH through the games. In the second game, do more with the visitor cards adding the layers of complexity.

If you deliberately choose to simplify the first game (or a half-game) to see this flow, I think she will love it. It's quite an attractive game.

I second this comment

Hilo ID 1908477:
Today I had the first crack at this game. I was so excited...

I was overwhelmed by the sheer randomness and uselessness of planing in this game.
Maybe we might have missed a rule of somekind... but...
I got a Mama/Papa card that lets me start with 2 purple and 1 blue.
All the other 4 players got green blue and yellow.

In my 2 purple cards I get 2 contracts to produce 4 white wines.
So I go for green cards and draw 3 cards only getting red wine...

While the player to my right plays a yellow card that gives him 5 money followed by another yellow cards that lets him draw 1 card of each type.
Thus later playing another yellow that let him draw green and instantly plant it.

And I am twiddling my thumbs with my starting 2 PURPLE Cards...

Winter phase comes I am thinking i will play my blue which lets me train a worker for 3 instead of 4...
The player to my right plays a card that lets him train a worker for 2 and the player to my left a card that lets him and everyone else train a worker for 1 gold if gets 1 point. It is turn one so everybody essentially does it. And I am still left with "train a worker for 3" card...

Next turn I draw 2 more green cards again get 2 red ones value 1 and 2. Next player get 2 green ( 1 from turn order) 1 for placing worker he get 2 card that gives him both 1 red and white each...

Another player puts down a yellow that makes him draw yellow cards from other player or get points. He chooses the 2 players that don't have yellow cards.. getting 2 more points from a card... he is now sitting at 6 points 2 turns in not having planted anything or done anything worthwhile except get yellow cards that randomly give him points.

So on turn 2 I am 10 money behind one player 5-6 points behind another
3 structures behind the 3rd and the 4th has fields that produce 4 grapes of combined value over 10... while my fields produce 3/1 red...


So...
Please help me understand how this game is balanced?

What good are my 2 starting purple cards? They give me 0 boost...

You can't plan what grapes you can plant.
Which I guess is OK, since you can't plan what contracts you will get.
From turn one you can get cards ranging from useless to cards that save you 3-4 workers placements with a single play (like draw 1 of each type)


The theme seems fantastic though...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purple cards are for later in the game. Filling wine orders is one way to make a ton of points.

Im playing on Tabletopsimulator and through the extended rules, retrieving your workers has changed.
Once youve placed all your workers, you "immediately" retrieve them.

On your next turn.

The card says "Plant 1 vine even without the required structure OR uproot and discard 1 vine to gain 2 VP."

Does this mean that I have to discard the vine which I uprooted, or can I uproot a vine and then discard any other vine which I have on my hand?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 11 of the rulebook describes this very card. You can discard any card from your hand; you're not restricted to the one you just uprooted.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whenever you uproot a vine, it goes to the discard pile, not back into your hand. So yes you have to discard the vine you uprooted. Think about it thematically. If you uproot a plant it almost always dies. Unless it is a weed of course.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is incorrect. Uprooted cards go back to your hand. See the description of the Yoke on page 12 and the glossary on the back cover.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damn. Thank you. (Yet) Another game we have been playing wrong. At least this is not an action we do very often.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I didn't know this either.
I've uprooted only a few times, but discarded believing the pay out was my exchange for the action.

Good clarification.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good catch!

I too have played this rule incorrectly.

In my defence m'lud, I was taught the rules, not having read them.

But surely the mistake is easy to make due to the wording on the card?

As it stands, "... OR uproot and discard 1 vine to gain 2 VP" infers, to my way of thinking, it is one and the same vine.

Whereas "... OR uproot 1 vine and discard 1 vine to gain 2 VP" would make it clearer, at least to me, and perhaps others....

But now I know the correct rule, I shall play to that. Heck, I might even read the rules!

Thanks again for the clarification.

If you play the entertainer visitor card, one option is to exchange 4 lira for 3 cards. I can't tell if the cards are winter visitors or orders cards. Which is it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They're winter visitor cards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can tell they are the winter visitor cards by the color. If it were any card, the card would be gray.

John: In some earlier printings of Viticulture, the blue icon is tough to distinguish from the purple icon of wine orders.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's right. I have an older version of the game. The blue appears to be more like violet to me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a file that lists all the visitor cards and what they do using words not colours. I am pretty sure this is the one but I didn't open it to make sure

Concur with Jamey. The printing I acquired it was tough to discern. Thankfully, we always assumed it was winter visitor cards as the 2nd half of the "OR" had to do with visitor cards :-).

I didn't have medium cellar but I played 'Zymologist' card which lets me make 2 wines of 4 or greater even without a medium cellar building.

So now I have 2 wines in the medium cellar.

Q: Do these wines still mature as per usual at the end of year even though I don't have a medium cellar? The rule book on 'maturing' states that you can't mature wines past 3 unless you have a medium cellar. But this is only referring to maturing from 3 to 4 (jumping from no cellar to medium cellar) right?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would say no. Let me explain why.

1) Zymologist refers only to making and storing the wine and does not mention aging. This leads me to believe the normal rules for aging apply. No alternative is offered.

2) The wording for maturing without a medium cellar does not mean “you can’t age from 3 to 4” it means “you cannot age or craft any wines beyond 3”.

Therefore: nope, the wine stays where it is until you build a better cellar
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I like Ben's logic, and I could see that being the case, but I decided to go a different way and say that since the token managed to get into the medium cellar, it acts as if it's in the medium cellar. There is a specific example explaining this under "Zymologist" on page 11 of the Viticulture Essential rulebook.

The last few times we have played, we have tried playing through a set number of rounds instead of racing up the scoreboard. First we tried with seven rounds, then we tried eight. Eight seemed better to us.

The advantage of this variant is that it allows you to plan your rounds with more awareness and build up for a big move on your final turn.

I am going to play a few more times at eight rounds and see how it goes, but so far it has proven to be really enjoyable.

If you try this version, please let me know what you think.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It could work, but it would definitely change the game. A big part of the race to the finish is usually if someone will get across the finish line on this round or not, and usually the leader is different if there’s one more round.

Interesting idea. May ask others if they want to try it.

My group finally got Viticulture to the table last night and had a great time. The end scoring was neck and neck, and we need some clarification on who was winner.

The rules state that "the current year will be played through the year end." Does the game end before or after the residual payment and aging steps?

My friend and I both ended up with 27 points, him with one Lira and me with none. However, I had one more residual payment than them. So if we get paid one last time, we would have tied on Lira and I'd have eked out a win on total wine value.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joe: Thanks for your question. The game ends after the end-game steps like residual payments and aging. Congrats on your win!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Awesome! Thank you so very much for confirming.

This boxed description of "Year End" is at the top of page 17 (Essential Edition, my highlight)

At the end of each year, players age wine and grape tokens, remove all workers from the board, collect any residual payments earned from filling orders, and rotate the first-player token counter-clockwise to the next player.

Like so many of you, my collection continues expanding an I find it ever more difficult to find games I can put up for sale. Today I played yet another wonderful game of Viticulture, and noticed that my Tuscany box not only takes up space, it also has some double components (since I own V:Essential Edition).

Viticulture essential with the Tuscany essential expansion are arriving tomorrow. What is the best way to go about learning this game? Just learn to play Viticulture 1st and then add in the Tuscany expansions. Or is there a short cut?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas: I would recommend learning and playing Viticulture at least a few times before adding in Tuscany. I think others may say that the best experience is with Tuscany (particularly the extended board), and while I would agree with that, jumping right to it is a little like reading a great sequel to a good book without reading book 1. Also, Viticulture is simpler to learn by itself than with Tuscany.

Thank you for buying them, though! I hope you have fun, and we're here on BGG and Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/groups/viticulture/) to answer any rules questions that arise.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I started with the base game before getting Tuscany. My personal opinion is that I wish I'd gotten Tuscany EE and integrated the extended board module from the get-go.

My analogy is that not integrating immediately would be like buying both an Economy class and First class ticket and trying out the Economy class first before moving to First class. You're not going back, but it probably makes you appreciate what you now have more! (Sorry, couldn't come up with a better analogy. )
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the advice. I will be learning with the wife. Sounds like it is best for us to learn Viticulture first and then start moving on though Tuscany. Actually Looking forward to taking it easy and slowly introducing the Tuscany expansions over time. No reason to rush it. Enjoy the experience slowly over time like a good wine.

Depending on your familiarity with heavy games, your first game may take a bit of time - when I teach Viticulture to new people, it takes 20-30 minutes to explain all the rules, and the game can be 60-90 minutes based on number of players.

However, it's all fairly logical and mostly thematic, so being able to tie the mechanisms to themes when teaching helps a lot to remember.

Plus Jamey has included a wonderful quick setup/rules reference card in the box so that's really good for referencing during the game without having to dive back into the rulebook.

Enjoy the game!

(We did some Tuscany playtesting before it was kickstarted, and never quite got as far as the extended board. Even nowadays, we still pretty much always just play the equivalent of V:EE, and still haven't quite got to bringing in the other Tuscany modules - probably because there's usually always at least one player who isn't all that familiar with the game).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Viticulture has 2 seasons and a total of 13 different action spaces on the board, plus one on your mat if you build for it. Tuscany raises that to 4 seasons, a section on the main board for stars to be placed with 6-7 choices, 17 action spaces on the board, and possibly three on your mat (6 is possible, but it would rarely be more than three). It requires a higher amount of planning from a broader range of choices.

It's up to you if you want to jump straight to Tuscany or not.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When we played our first game, I taught it using the Tuscany board, but nothing else from Tuscany (workers or structures). My reasoning was that this way I didn't have to teach a whole new season/passing system when we moved into Tuscany. It worked fine for us! Though I do feel a little bad that the original board is just sitting there...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is exactly my thoughts, too. The way Tuscany does the seasons makes the original board obsolete.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wouldn't go against Jamey, but if you have played worker placements before I would jump right into the extended board.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My wife and I currently play Caverna / LeHavre and Yokohama regularly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I recommend reading the rulebooks for both the base and Tuscany, then I think you'll get a pretty good feel for whether you want to incorporate the extended board immediately.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I ended up teaching Viticulture EE without any of Tuscany included. Played a 3 player game with my wife and daughter. Having read through the rule book and watched Rodney's watch it played video, I found it very easy to teach.

Multiple times my wife noted how the rules fit the theme. For example both my daughter and wife assumed that after you harvest, the planted vine cards would be discarded. When I explained that they stay in the fields, she immediately was like "ohhh because Vineyards leave their vines and harvest just the grapes".

I referred back to the rules for the end of year process but that was about it.

So after one game I am very happy with the purchase. The theme seems to hit home for both my wife and daughter.

At this point I am going to get another game or 2 in before introducing anything from Tuscany EE.

Looking forward to our next game
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Second play of Viticulture has been logged and WOW what a great game!

My wife dropped 1 of my daughters off at Gymnastics practice and we were able to get a game in while having morning coffee before she was done.

Played this one at 2 players. Rules were easy to remember. I usually grabbed the rule book for the end of year sequence, but most everything you need to know is clearly marked on the board.

My wife took on a strategy of using the visitor cards, while I tried filling out order cards. The game was very close and came down to the last turn.

As soon as we finished I wanted to play again. But it was Saturday and there was work to be done. So looking forward to game 3.

Loving this game and have not even tapped into the Tuscany EE box.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm glad you're continuing to have fun with Viticulture, Douglas! Thanks for sharing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Games 3,4 and 5 have now been played between my wife and me.

My thoughts after 5 plays.

We have not added any extras from the Tuscany expansion. The strategy has plenty of depth as is for us. There are many paths to take while traveling in Viticulture. Build an early Windmill to power your vine planting? How about a Cottage to entice visitors to come see you? Surely you would not regret building a Tasting room, but it comes at the heaviest cost. Perhaps in the early game you want to concentrate on bringing more workers to your vineyard.

Still more decisions to make as you could acquire wine orders or vine cards. Both of which will effect your long game strategy.

Viticulture EE has moved into my top ten games. Just a fantastic experience with a unique theme that draws my wife in. Looking forward to traveling to Tuscany soon.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Game 6

We added the new board from Tuscany. (no special workers or extra buildings)

My wife is not a heavy gamer but we had no problems moving to the new board.

Things I enjoyed:

1) There are now bonuses in the 2 players game for being first to a location.
2) The trading location. Say you do not like the vine cards or the orders you have drawn. Send a worker here and discard 2 cards and draw 2 new ones. Great addition to help solve the unlucky draws.
3) My first play on the new board, but it felt to me like the games engine picked up speed quicker.
4) Turn marker placement. Really presents some tuff choices. I could see in a 4 player game where this becomes very strategic and fun. But in the 2 player game it sometimes felt like there was an obvious spot for me to go.
5) We used the influence map but did not give victory point bonuses due to 2 player game. (rulebook suggestion) Again I could see the fun of the map increasing greatly with more players.

Next game I plan to flip the board over and use the extra buildings.

The only issues I have is my wife has mentioned frustration after the last 3 games. She is usually a few victory points behind when I go out. This seems to be wearing on her. So I am in the realm of not wanting to let her win, but not wanting the frustration to ruin the game for her. Any ideas?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If it was me, I'd probably just let her win a game, lol.

But that might not be fun for you. When this happens for me, I sometimes try to experiment with new things to see if it would work out, even if it seems like it might be a losing strategy, just for fun.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I like the idea of trying a strategy that is perhaps a little off the wall. I may even find an old dirt road I enjoy more than the interstate.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was introduced to the game with Tuscany (extended board only), I've always played it with Tuscany, and now I have a copy, I will always teach it with Tuscany. (I do end up reminding people about the area control bit though)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most people would regret it - the requirement to have wine in your cellar to gain VP (which was introduced after release to prevent a no-wine strategy from winning) made the building completely useless, except for playing the visitor cards that give VP based on structures.

(it is still possible to gain VP from it on turn 1, but you need a Papa card that lets you start with the room. Then you trade 2 cards for a grape, make a wine token and give a tour)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1816267:
I played Viticulture for the first time last night, and it was not a fun experience. All of my friends had played through it at least once so after getting a run down of the rules, and mechanics I thought I had the gist of the game.

My starting hand was two white 3's and a red 4. My starting order required a white of 3 and a champagne of 8. I ended up being the first player and had no clue if I should try to be first last or where to even go once I started placing workers. I decided to plant my two whites and draw 2 more vine cards in the spring. I ended up with another white 3 and another red 4. From there I focused on trying to recruit workers.

I could not get a hold of any strategy to actually turn my grapes into wine. I understand the mechanics but it seemed every action I tried to do was a dead end. When I took cards whether they wore orders, or workers the resulting card seemed to do me no good. With the cards I had I needed to build both cellars but I had no way to get money. By round 3 I was frustrated and realized that I was stuck and felt like I had no good options. Analysis paralysis was taking over and when my friend prompted me to take my second turn of the round I just passed as I had no idea what to do. From that point on I just decided to not really play and started just passing every round. We (thankfully) only played 4 rounds due to time restraints.

I want to understand how to do well with this game so I have a chance of enjoying it if it makes it way back to our table. Did I have a challenging starting hand for a new player? What are the optimal moves early on? What round should I aim to be filling orders? Are there any good videos that show actual game play (with no expansion) where the players explain the decisions being made? I just need something to help me wrap my head around this game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't think the starting vine cards you have are particularly relevant at all. I rarely think about them much at all.

When I play, I generally don't worry about planting early. I rarely plant in the first or second rounds. I try to get workers, build the cottage, and then see what visitor cards and wine orders I can get. Those will shape your strategy. Once you kind of know what wine orders you want to be aiming at, and all the funky planting/harvesting/etc. visitor cards you have, then you can start figuring out what to plant. That might involve building a trellis or irrigation. Or maybe just give up on the vine cards you started with and draw new ones.

There are ways to get points that don't involve wine orders, especially on the visitor cards, and you should be doing those too. Don't get me wrong, you probably want to fill some decent wine orders too, but those usually are late in the game for me.

If you're lost, don't just pass. Pick a simple goal and pursue that... like maybe filling a particular wine order. If nothing else, you'll get experience at how the parts of the game work, which you'll miss by just passing.

One thing I cannot stress enough is that visitor cards are game changing in this game. Don't ignore them. If they aren't a part of your plan, then you're probably missing an opportunity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every visitor card I ended up getting seemed worthless to me in the early game. I could see them maybe being able to be useful in the late game once I had wine or had more buildings but none of them gave me any benefit in round 3/4. My orders all required me to have a large cellar and that was my goal but I had no way to get money to build without using my grande. By my calculation it would have been round 6 before I could do anything. By round 4 everyone else had at least 2 orders filled.

And yes I understand passing is not good to learn the game but at that point we had 20 minutes before being kicked out of the game store and I knew that me continuing to play would take up half of that due to my AP, so I decided to yield my time so the other 3 people could at least get some joy out of playing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've only played a few times, but here are a few things.

1. If you're trying for a high-value order, go ahead and harvest the grapes for it early. That way they can age into the needed values while you get everything else set up.

2. If you need cash early, sell a field (or two). I've won games where I only ever planted in one field.

3. Don't try to do everything at once. At the beginning of the game, it's impossible to plant harvest, make wine, and fill an order in the same round. Just focus on a goal for the year.

Other than that, since you mention having no options, are you sure you played with the correct number of spaces open? With 4, you should have had two spots available for each action.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was a little confused about whether that starting hand reflected vine cards or wine orders.

If I had vine cards of 3 or 4 I would
A. Build necessary support structures, then
B. Plant the red and white vines in the 7-value field to maximize its harvest,
C. Let the grapes age on the crush pad and repeat harvests, while expanding cellars
D. Look for bigger wine orders

Year One: A and B
Harvest every year you can.

Try making wines from 3rd year on

But, that's what I'd do...I'm sure there are other alternatives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes we played with 2 spots for each thing, however by round 3 I was placing my chicken 3rd (then 4th in round 4) and had no chance to go first. And due to my sub-optimal moves leading nowhere in rounds 1 and 2 needed very specific spaces to be unoccupied in very specific order and it just was not there.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes the starting was the vine numbers. And I had a wine order that required a 7 sparkling. My issue was I planted the white 3's in the lower fields and never drew anything lower than a 3 so I could never combine things into 1 harvest action which seemed really slow. I feel like after looking at the grape deck and reading other threads I just had a starting hand that was not good for a first time player in the early stages of the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sounds like you were playing the original version, without the big meeple or the revised visitor cards? 4 player game? With the original version:

- some of the visitor cards are very situational (the revised cards are better for this)
- it's easier to be blocked out of action spots, especially with even player counts (the big meeple helps with this).

I usually go the route mentioned by Val above, plant red and white early (may require trellis or irrigation) and then harvest each round, build a yoke to help with this. This gets the aging process going and you can then focus on building cellars and getting suitable wine orders. Give tours to get money.

In our games the building spot is highly contested early on.

I also like to build the cottage to give more visitor cards, sometimes they can be very powerful.

You can also get points by waking up late.

I don't worry too much about extra workers, but do normally get at least one more. This is a game where you can have too many workers, and nothing for them to do.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The engine building in Viticulture can be painfully slow. It's not unusual for people to hover around 3 or 4 points and jump 1x points in one year when all their hard work pays off.

Money is indeed hard to come by in early games. You can either earn those through giving tours or selling grapes. Don't invest in more workers unless you know what you want to do with them. I don't ever goes for extra worker unless the visiter cards give me some discount.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on your description, you must have been playing with Mamas & Papas (starting with 3 vines and an irrigation tower). Going first with your cards, my first three moves are:

1) Build the Trellis in (cost of 1 coin since you can take the bonus)
2) Plant a white 3 and a red 4 in the same field
3) Harvest that field (do this every year)

In many circumstances, you will never need to plan anther vine.

In subsequent years, you can take tours and flip fields for money, hire workers, and build buildings. Try to make sure to harvest your field every year.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You give wine tours to get money, and flip fields when convenient.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Had we been playing, you would have received some guidance. Your starting hand was actually very good.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Probably year 4. If you draw the right wine orders, you have a very good chance of winning the game in 6 years.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The summer visitors (yellow ones) tend to be a bit more useful in the early game -- things related to vine cards, getting money, building structures, etc. The winter visitors (blue cards) tend to be more useful in the later game -- harvesting and making wine, filling wine orders, getting points, etc.

However, that isn't 100% true, as there are winter visitors that get you workers, and summer visitors that get you grapes, and things like that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I always first get all the workers and cottage and then worry about the rest But of course you need to have use for those. I usually use them to get extra points from all the possible locations. In my opinion in these kind of games where there is no penalty for having more workers (feeding etc) more is better.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The "penalty" or more realistically, the opportunity cost is that you're spending one of your action per turn to get a new worker for the first few turn, while I could be spending mine to plant grape, harvest, or draw/play cards. Not counting the temp worker, you will have the same amount of actions as mine until turn 4, where your new workers finally start to make a difference.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While you are correct about the opportunity cost and not coming out ahead until year 4, the difference in that 4th year is significant, while the sacrifice is really only a single action in the 1st year.

Action that aren't training:
Year 1:
- Me: 2
- You: 3
Year 2:
- Me: 3 (Total 5)
- You: 3 (Total 6)
Year 3:
- Me: 4 (Total 9)
- You: 3 (Total 9)
Year 4:
- Me: 6 (Total 15)
- You: 3 (Total 12)
...
Year 7:
- Me: 6 (Total 33)
- You: 3 (Total 21)

Of course, this logic doesn't take into account visitor cards (yours or opponent's) that let you train workers, or being able to build the school (Tuscany EE structure) early, or the benefit early grapes can get you from aging. As in any good game, one strategy isn't always the best.

Edit: This also doesn't take into account the ₤9-₤12 it costs to train them, or the actions required to get that money.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for showing the calculation. It's indeed a huge leaps from turn 4 onward. However, part of my strategy (in vanilla Viticulture, with Pa&MA and new visiter cards) is to plant and harvest as early as possible to have more grapes to utilise, thus the early actions weigh more for me than the later ones. It's not uncommon to find people with 5 or 6 meeples running out of thing to do just because they don't have the grapes or wine or order in later rounds.

Plus, like you said, there's also actions required to gain those coins, which is hard to come by in the early rounds.

Different people use different strategy though, I'm just sharing my general observation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, it's certainly really valuable to get that early grape/wine economy going. I've never actually tried playing a game where I didn't end up with at least 5 workers. I may have to give that a shot sometime and see how it goes. I also may have to try snagging first position in year 1, immediately selling a field, then using my grande to be able to train twice in the first season. Just to see how the extremes of no-training vs early training play out. (Caveat -- I never play Viticulture without at least the Tuscany board any more.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In vanilla-Viticulture (with new visitor cards), I usually go Trellis-plant-harvest (if I can) and then try to harvest once each turn. In turn 2 or 3 I get an additional worker, which is often the only additional worker I get.

But a strategy also depends on the turnorder of the first turns, of course.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1805701:
I played my second game of viticulture last night and wanted to clarify question that came up with teacher and others cards. Teacher allows you to make up to two wine tokens. At first we played this as an ability without requiring grapes on crushpad and later we realised we think we played this wrong when a similar card was played. I assume this lets you take the action but you need the grapes on your crushpad?

Also thanks to Jamey for a great game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, you need grape tokens. It works like the action spot on the board. So you convert grape tokens into wine tokens.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roel is correct. Dommon, there are a few visitor cards that say "gain a grape token" or "gain a wine token." When the word "gain" is used, it means that you simply take a glass token and place it on the appropriate place on your vineyard mat. Otherwise when the "harvest" or "make wine" terminology is used, you have to follow the standard rules for those actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1798048:
Had our first run of the game tonight, while most of us progressed through making wine and filling orders, one player just focused on victory points, eg playing yellow+blue cards tactfully and electing the extra victory point during spring's turn order

To cut a long story short, they won the game without performing a single harvest, let alone any wine.

Sure, the other player (who were all new) didn't help matters by accepting the offers to build structures at a discount (not realising the amount of VP's he would get) but the question was asked at the end of the game, is the mechanics flawed if a player can do this?

Any thoughts ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No. It's simply another strategy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tactfully? He showed sensitivity in the face of a difficult issue? Or did you mean tactically?

From what I understand, Collector's Edition (2nd edition base + Tuscany) can be played as-is or as an Essentials experience.

The to-do items:
* Download new rules (currently the Essential Edition PDF).
+ Are the rules summaries included in the box still ok to use? The main change is no point limit yeah? Maybe the best thing is to replace the ones from the box with the "Panda" download.

* Check to see if the 5/7 switcheroo stickers are needed (selling and buying back a field should cost the same).

* Check to see if the Essential Edition stickers are needed (the Tasting Room and "Sell at Least One Grape or Buy/Sell One Field" changes).

* If I like, I can download the full list of Essential Edition Visitor Cards and make sure those are the ones we play with.
+ USE all the Advanced cards, removing the non-advanced version from the appropriate decks. Use this list to help get to 76 total cards: https://boardgamegeek.com/article/21482210#21482210 (this list has a handy "a" for advanced).
+ Add 4 new visitors (2 summer, 2 winter) from Arboriculture.

* Card changes:
+ The wording on the Promoter card has changed from "and" to "or".
+ The Homesteader card has changed from a $1 discount to a $3 discount.

* Do I need to care about Tuscany Essential Edition? (I don't think so)

* Anything else?

In any case, the Tuscany box is still full of gaming goodness. Cows and cheese, can't go wrong there I would guess...

Out of curiosity are there any cards that are misprints and should be discarded? For example I see 3 different versions of the Merchant card: 1) "Fill 1 wine order and/or..." 2) "Fill 1 wine order and..." 3) "Pay 3 lira to..." (actually this is the Advanced version to be used for an Essentials experience).

Thx in advance! :-)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sounds like you've got a good handle on most of it. There's zero reason for you to care about Tuscany EE if you've got the full Collector's version. You already have everything in there, plus more.

One of those Merchant cards is a misprint, but I don't recall which. The updated card was included with Tuscany.

Stonemeier writes in his FAQ:

If you place a worker on an action space that has a bonus, you must take that action, but the bonus is optional. You may take the bonus before or after you take the action.

This only makes sense if you are not able to complete the bonus, like play a second card that you don't have.

On the other hand, if I understand this correctly, you CANNOT place a worker on an action space if you are not able to complete the action. In other words, if you don't have any visitor cards, you CAN'T take up the space, even with a Grande worker. Correct?

Note: I am referring to the rules printed in the 2nd edition.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alex: If you can't (or won't) take the action, you can't place a worker on the action. In your example, if you don't have any visitor cards, you can't place a worker on either of the "play a visitor card" actions. Similarly, if you have a visitor card, you can't place a worker on a "play a visitor card" action and decide not to play the visitor card.

Basically, don't block players purely for the purpose of blocking.

Jamey also gets a nod for his compassion

http://kotaku.com/board-games-are-helping-my-wife-recover-fr...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you so much for sharing that! Since my wife is my favorite gaming partner, that story kinda hit me in the gut. (I'll admit it... got a bit emotional reading that.)

Kudos to Jamey Stegmaier for running a game group that supports her! I wish them the best.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nice article.

It make us think about the precious things we have in life.
Nothing is granted forever so we should always be happy to be healthy.

Thanks for sharing and kudos to Jamey!

Incredible story, I wish her a speedy, and a fun recovery, and Jamey Your the man.. Its great to have someone like you in the gaming community

Jeff and Mira are wonderful people--it's a pleasure for me to play games with them on a regular basis.

Heard good things about Viticulture, and a friend of mine is selling off his Viticulture + Tuscany, and I am wondering what is the different between V:EE + Tuscany. Or Should I just go for V:EE + T:EE?

Thanks in advance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are some expansion modules in Tuscany that are not in Tuscany EE. It's the modules that according to polls were used the least.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first question in the Tuscany FAQ on our home page goes into more detail about the differences: https://stonemaiergames.com/games/viticulture/tuscany-essent...

The original Tuscany will likely be hard to get hold off for a reasonable price, since it's been out of print for a while.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V:EE already includes a few of the Tuscany modules.
Tuscany:EE includes 3 other modules: the extended board (a must...), structures and special workers.
A few of the original Tuscany modules are neither in V:EE nor T:EE, but those modules were the "worst".

So basically if you get V:EE+Tuscany you will have a few modules twice, and if you get V:EE+T:EE you will have all that is "Essential"

I highly recommand going for both Essential editions.
- original Tuscany is very hard to find
- original Tuscany is far far more expensive than the Essential edition and having the missing modules is not worth it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'd love to see a chart that compares all the versions? I've got Viticulture 2nd edition (not essential) and the full Tuscany, and there's a ton of stuff in it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There's a chart at the bottom of this page: https://stonemaiergames.com/games/viticulture/

And a chart specifically about Tuscany on the sidebar of this page (click to make it bigger): https://stonemaiergames.com/games/viticulture/tuscany-essent...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unless you are a collector/completionist I would recommend V:EE+T:EE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you get Viticulture + Tuscany for a good price you should get it.

In addition to the changes mentioned above, there were also some changes to the cards. You can essentially construct the Essential Edition by putting together cards from Viti + Tuscany.

Read:
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1530857/card-list-essential...

And:
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1506548/viticulture-essenti...

They cleaned up the decks for the essential edition. If you want the essential edition cards you will have to change the Promoter card and the Homesteader card.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh, and I kind of like the Formagio expansion in the original Tuscany. They no longer add that.

But I am in the minority on this opinion I think.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks David, I was able to buy V + T + Moor from my friend for $40. All I need now is the Viticulture Update Pack (1.0 > 2.0).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the recommendation, but I was able to grab V + T + Moor from friend.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the info Sebastien I was able to grab V + T + Moor from friend.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you Morten, I did not know about the site before I ask, the info on there is very helpful.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you Jamey, the charting chart is great. I was able to grab V + T + Moor from friend, and I think I am missing the Viticulture Update Pack (1.0 > 2.0), any idea where I can buy them? I didn't see it on your website, nor Amazon or Ebay.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So your friend had Viti 1.0 with Tuscany and didn't get the upgrade?

Do you have the grande worker? They are the larger sized workers, one in each color.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yea, he collects the game and never played them.

I see 6 workers, same size.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jotaro shared his request with me on the Viticulture Facebook group, and we'll figure it out for him.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamey Stegmaier, Speaking of the expansions that were not included in the new version of Tuscany, Will Formaggio, Patronage, Arboriculture, and Mafia ever be made available at a later date in ala Carte or were they removed as I was too late to grab them? I do see the special workers which is nice to be able to see that but I was hoping for Arboriculture. I played with Arboriculture before with a friend before I got a chance to try it out and enjoyed that expansion piece.

I unfortunately was not able to get the game when it first came out so when Essential was made available I did leap at the chance, its a shame we cant get it all :(

I have to applaud you, regardless, that you were able to streamline the price down for Tuscany Essentials. I really appreciated that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hector: Thanks for your question. I'm going to check with my shipping helpers to see if we have any extra Patronage or Mafia expansions. We've never offered them ala Carte because people weren't interested in them.

As for Formaggio and Arboriculture, we're always gathering info to see if there's enough demand to reprint them on our future printing form: https://stonemaiergames.com/about/future-printing-request-fo...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I for one, enjoy Formaggio. I don't really know why. I just like the wine and cheese pairing.

I was less of a fan of the morale track thing personally.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What's the one where you have the face down order card you need to fulfill? I liked that one. Kept people guessing who was ahead.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patronage has the secret goals, if that's what you're referring to.

My 20 year anniversary is next week and my wife told me to order whatever game I want for my gift. So guess what I picked?

If I order Viticulture Essential, Tuscany Essential, the bag of coins and the moor expansion, would that get me essentially everything?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gratz .

I'm happy to hear that you chose our game for such a special occasion - the game is pretty special to me, since it was the first published game I was involved in and without it I probably wouldn't have landed a job in the board game business.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes - well unless I'm forgetting something .

As an aside was the use of "essentially" an intentional pun?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ordered everything this morning, very excited! I imagine for Viticulture / Tuscany to be a game my wife and I will play for the next 20 years. We currently enjoy Caverna, LeHavre and Yokohama 2 player. I think Viticulture will fit right into the rotation. I also get the feeling that this could be the best themed game for my wife that I have come across.

I also dig how Stonemaier gives you options for upgrading components.
Metal coins are ordered, need to see what options meeple source has available for Viticulture.

Through the years it became harder and harder to find things for my wife and I to do together. Sure we were raising our children, but we needed something to do together that we both enjoyed. Hobby board games have helped to fill that void. So it is very fitting for Viticulture to symbolize our 20th anniversary.

Hello there!
May I plant 2 vines of the same type in 1 field?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
as long as the total is less than 6 value. (or 5/6/7 when playing with the fields expansions)

So you can't plant two red-4 or white-4 on the same field. But you could plant 3 pinot vines (1red/1white) on the same field.


and remember, you only produce at most 2 grapes on each field (up to 1 red and 1 white, each equal to the sum of red/white values on that field)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tks a lot!

I like the look of this but wondered if there was solo rules, if so how does it play?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, there are solo rules (via the Automa AI). For those who use them to play Viticulture the AI is extremely well regarded (and has led to an enormous amount of success for the designer of the Automa "system").

If you are interested in solo play for this or any other game, I'd recommend looking at Solitaire Resouces - and in particular,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm not sure how you currently get hold of the Automa as I got mine in the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
, years ago.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't have much experience with it solo, but it seems good and I know people who really enjoy it solo. Generally the Automa system that is used in Viticulture has proven excellent.

If you get
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
it comes with the Automa. If you have the original Viticulture you'll need Tuscany. I believe there are also web implementations that would allow you to add in the Automa if those aren't good options for you.

So there are cards--producer--that allows for the retrievement of workers. I am wondering if this statement is for ONLY normal workers or both played normal workers and the Grande worker.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It depends on the card. If it's a worker icon, it's read as "any worker." It'll specifically state if it's only referring to regular workers or grande workers.

Wine. Fluid of gods, who descend to us on Earth from time to time and provide means to caress our taste buds. Each year, new harvest is maturing in vineyard. But by collecting, the process is far from over. Grapes have a long way to go, before they reach the desired rounded glass and delight their fans.

It has only two colors and you will be able to identify them closely thanks to authors Jamey Stegmaier and Alan Stone. Their game Viticulture covers whole life cycle of wine from seed to orders. Based on these two names, name of the company Stonemaier Games is derived and we will see more games from them in the future, for example Euphoria. We had a second edition of Viticulture on our table. It should be noted, that the first one has faced with some complaints and disgruntled players and this was the main reason to publish second, improved version.

Box is slightly oblong, but also a little higher, than we are used to. Unusual dimension are filled with a big chunk of components, that start on one common board of the vineyards. It contains not only the graphical representation of waiting spaces on each point of interest, but also storage space for decks, scale of victory points and table of early birds (wakey, wakey!).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For each opponent is also prepared his own board with lots of rising values (where wine will be placed) and fields with space for planting and harvesting wine. That allows inclusion of 118 cards, that represent not only wine, but also coming of different visitors (summer and winter). Altogether, four packages differ in appearance. While incoming people have text on their cards, wine and orders do only with numbers, whether they mark value wine, amount of orders or profit in the form of points.

On the way to the resulting liquid, players will also be accompanied by pile of wooden tokens. They have different shapes and represent workers, wine grapes, but there are also roosters or various buildings in player colors. Players push also 72 tokens of lire in three different values out of their place in cardboard sheets.

Each player chooses his color and gets rooster, victory points marker, but primarily workers (starting with two small and one master) and buildings. All made of wood. Scoring space is occupied on zero, while rooster is placed above waking table.Rivals of course also get their own board and one card from each wine deck as well as one summer customer. All packages are then shuffled and placed at the designated places on the plan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Individual rounds are divided into four seasons – spring, summer, autumn and winter. Spring tells story of waking up and crawling from behind the stove. Players can choose their own order, which is interesting for them and all this on scale out of seven positions. While the player with the lowest number (and not necessarily just one) has the advantage of going sooner, others get some reward for their handicaps (cards, money, etc.).

In the summer, now players can use their workers and send them to one of the six available places on the board. They make guided tours for money, but also spend it and build buildings on their own property. They can also get a wine card or plant a vineyard, simply by placing cards on the corresponding spot (multiple cards can be stacked on top of each other). Summer visitors can also be played and especially sales of already crushed grapes may be completed.

Constructed buildings give players some advantages, but also some action boxes. Most of the time, buildings bring some extra money from sale of older and better wine, as well as victory points for each tour or planting. Other buildings (eg. irrigation system) are requirement for player to ever grow some types of wine. And after such a merriment, fall occurs. Resting time for winemaker, in which they watch vineyards and only invite one of the visitors to his vineyard in the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Winter is on the other hand full of new activities and there is a choice of seven actions, when they practically coincide with already played summer options. But be careful, because player my use only free workers, who had not worked in the summer!

And again, he can obtain card, this time representing received orders. Support function is here done also by hiring new workers. But only now, players can harvest field, transform grapes into wine and parry any of the orders.Harvesting involves counting cards from one specific field, separately for white and red wine. Their sum appoints position of a given value, where player puts a translucent stone on his crushers, where the grapes will wait for further action. Other activities can crush those grapes and move them into the cellar, where they age into a delicious liquid beverage. With finished wine, player can cover any of the orders and gain victory points, but also a shift on small scale of bonus payouts.

At the end of the round, wine matures and not just in the cellar, but also on crushers. Players move their tokens to higher number. All workers return home to be able to work in the spring again. Now players also receive a bonus payment for order fulfillment. Starting player (the one, that selected sooner getting up time) changes. After several rounds, one has to check, if some of players has gained twenty victory points. In this case, game ends with the victory of this particular winemaker.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Viticulture does not excel in originality of theme, but in its processing. There are no new elements, that you would never have seen before, but they still might be assembled into tremendously entertaining whole. And this was done here. Game offers a wide variety of ways to earn points and thus different paths to victory. In addition, the very beginning of each round, when selecting time of getting up, is great, though not entirely original.

It is not somehow extremely difficult game. Some liken it to a little more complex Stone Age. This means, that it is not suitable for complete beginners, but already player with some experience will not be lost and can enjoy it. Their chances on victory are slightly influenced by luck of draw. Good orders may mean really positive news for gamers. But thanks to them, you must try to remain flexible, because sweet reward is always waiting there to be grasped.

As well as other worker-placement games, also Viticulture has its own specific rules of worker placement. Each position can be occupied only one, but only one of the boxes allows player to get a bonus – first comes, first served. Exception to this rule is master, who can share the field with any other pawn. This figure extends capabilities of players and there will never be problem of blocked place, where you need to get, but can´t. Even in this situation, you have a chance of taking it and we really like it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Playing in different numbers of opponents is distinguished by the amount of spaces, that are available to them. This makes the battle for the wine always difficult, but in an even number a little bit more challenging (4, 6). Depending on the number of participants, tactics is also changing, when with two or three you will focus more on the tasting room, while more rivals bring village to the front. In addition, most of the match time, all players have a chance to win and it is not clear, who will emerge as the only and true champion in the end from behind wine barrels.

Buildings are important for strategy regardless which of them player chooses. Each building has its own significant bonuses, that can be useful. And maybe you just then discover, that way to win is not automatically to gather as many workers and then send them out to do actions.
Here, it is necessary to add, that the game is excellent (really!) in two players. You have more turns to do stuff, because boxes with bonuses are not available. And because of this, you can also discover new strategies and long-term plans are worth more, than in matches with higher number of participants.

There are no significant conflicts, but this surprisingly does not matter. Peaceful wine growing somehow includes fun, even with each player minding his own stuff. You will be competing only for special fields, and then meet up at the finish line. That is only after some ninety minutes, which may be a surprise number to anyone. Due to this, it is just enough time for you to develop strategies and really enjoy it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to all this, Viticulture is really nice game in processing. Detailed and clear boards are complemented by beautiful wooden pieces, that give the game the right atmosphere. This time, the real feeling of producing wine is not missing. Theme is filled to one hundred percent, although there are more games with similar topic (Grand Cru, Vintage – review).

Viticulture is an excellent game. But when you decide, if this is game for you, everything will probably break on the fact, whether you like worker-placement. If yes, this game is at the forefront with the very best in the genre, and you can not make a mistake by buying it. You will enjoy it for a long time. Otherwise, you can still be persuaded by processing and beautiful theme. Remember, Viticulture is really matured game of the year!

I already got Viticulture Essential and Tuscany Essential but haven't opened them yet. Today I placed an order for the Moors expansion. Is there any overlap? else I return the Moors expansion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No. I think there's like 1 or 2 cards in one of them that is duplicated in another, but they are really completely distinct. That's the same combo I have and it's really all you need with Viticulture.

Moor visitors is a completely new set of visitors cards, not seen in Tuscany or base Viticulture. Replacement Promoter and Harvest Machine cards are also included.

Welcome to Reviews for Color Blindness. The aim of this series is to have a spot to discuss how a game plays for people who are colorblind. For the unfamiliar, colorblindness is more like blurry vision than the ability to not see any color (except for a small percentage - monochromacy/achromatopsia). For those with poor vision, a small letter E far away is hard to discern, and a giant letter E right in front of them is easy to discern. Similarly for someone with red/green deficiency (deuteranopes) may have a hard time discerning a small red swatch far away, but close up it can be clearer. There is a wide spectrum of blurry vision problems, and there is also with color blindness. This review is for discussing how colors are used in this game, and how much colorblindness (atleast mine - deuteranomalous) effects gameplay.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Viticulture, players work to transform their small vineyards into success. It’s a very colorful and inviting game. Let’s look how color is used in the game and if colorblind players may be affected by the design.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player pieces
Players receive a plethora of pieces in a variety of shapes. There are cellars, a rooster, a windmill, cork and wine bottle. Some pieces stay on your player board, but the cork, rooster, wine bottle, and workers will go on the board and be mixed with other players pieces. If any colors are hard to discern, you may have trouble playing with a full complement of players. I haven't had a hard time picking the colors of the pieces apart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wine
In the game, there are two types of grapes and four wines. The grapes are red and white so shouldn't present a problem for colorblind players. The wine symbols on cards and the board for red and white wine are the same shape, but different colors. Blush and sparkling wines have distinct shapes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cards
There are four types of cards in the game that are referenced only by color. The card backs have pictures that can distinguish them, but the icons do not.

Green - Grape Plants
Yellow - Summer Visitor
Purple - Wine Orders
Blue - Winter Visitor



The small card icons on the small cards can be hard to distinguish. And it can affect gameplay, because you do not want to ask the other players the colors of the icons on your hidden cards. The cards are not chosen from a pool, but from a deck. So there is no chance for clarification. Not too many of the cards have the icons, so you may want to consider the impact. Only the blue/purple affect me, and sometimes the text on the card gives enough context to determine it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The icons are also used on the turn order track and some of the action spaces, but that can be clarified before it affects gameplay. Your player board also has a summer/winter visitor icon.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
Viticulture is a very nice vibrant looking game. There are a few places in the game where color is the only channel of information given to a player to make a decision. Color blind players will need to inspect the pieces/cards to see if they can distinguish the pieces enough to play. For me, there is a few times during the game, where I have a hard time with blue/purple icons. Comparing other icons in the game help to distinguish them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Took me a while to figure out what you meant by blue/purple icons - The card draw icons! ^^. I can certainly see those being problematic, particularly in poor lighting since they're both in dark shades. Perhaps SM games could consider adding a card icon for the card draw symbols (Vine/Sun/Cart/Snowflake maybe, and a Building for Tuscany's structures) in future printings.

Hello all. I just enjoyed my first solo game of viticulture essential with all three Tuscany essential expansions. I lost 32 to 30 or 32 to 27 depending on how you interpret the Mercado structure card. "Whenever you draw 1 order card you may immediately fill it". I used the draw an order card action in fall and got the bonus which allowed me to draw 2 cards. Could I fill one or both those cards with the Mercado power or is it when I only draw specifically "one" card? Cheers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David: Thanks for quoting the text on the card! That's always helpful when answering a question. With the Mercado, you could immediately fill both of those wine orders if you have the wine ready for them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you so much for the quick answer. That means I only lost by 2 points. Revenge!! Keep making awesome games!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Does this card trigger only with the "draw" space on the board in fall, or does it trigger every time you get an order card (ie from a wake up chart bonus?).

Thank you,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whenever you draw an order card for any reason.

Hi There,

I have had Viticulture 2.0 for a while and have the upgrade kit for VitEE. Today i found a copy of the original Tuscany on clearance at my FLGS. Is there any need for me to have the VitEE Upgrade Kit now?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark: Technically, no. The cards will have slightly different names, but the text on them is the same. And you'll need to get stickers for the property tiles in Tuscany (we can provide that). Otherwise I can't think of a reason why you'd need both Tuscany and the Viticulture Essential Upgrade Pack.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the clearance price? It might be a good deal compared to the new Tuscany expansion (which I HIGHLY recommend if you don't have it).

If you don't have the new version of Tuscany, then getting the old one could be a really good deal because the Extended board, structure cards, and special workers are great.

If price is not a consideration the only reason to get the original Tuscany is if you want to get the modules:
1) Formagio
2) Arboriculture
3) Patronage
4) Mafia

These are not in the new version of Tuscany. None of these are worth paying a lot of money for. I think Formagio is kind of fun. The other three (imho) are not good.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Synopsis: You are a pre-modern Tuscan viticulturist, and you are in the business of growing grapes. You will harvest them, and crushing them into whites, reds, rosés, and sparkling wines through the judicious application of your workforce.

Viticulture is a worker placement game, but stems away from the genre’s staples in the way that the board divides a single game year into two (or four if using the Tuscany expansion). Workers used in the first half are not available in the second half, and since the two halves of the year are seasonally thematic you must decide whether to concentrate on growing your cottage industry or harvesting the fruits of your labour.

Viticulture superbly adds to this tension, firstly by allowing multiple slots on given work placements, but by highlighting one of those spots with a bonus to the person who gets there first. Moreover, their latter addition of the ‘grande worker’ allows players to select a space already taken. This means there are contingencies already built into the game.

Commentary: Viticulture takes the typical tension of worker placement, and adds to it. whereby devolves from having to make decisions about what space to take on your turn, while also taking risks on what to leave open for other players to take. Sometimes you have two choices, both of which are important and so you inevitably need to formulate contingency plans in case you have been blocked in a critical space.

Better yet, all of the choices make thematic sense. This means the game plays out very intuitively because half of what your options come across as obvious. Though you may need to pay closer attention to the various visitors that come through as well as some of the buildings that you can put into play.

Verdict: While Viticulture was not the first game for Stonemaier, it was the game that brought them strongly into prominence and established Jamey Stonemaier as a voice for the Kickstarter community.

Expansions: The major expansion, Tuscany, builds itself somewhat as a legacy style expansion, with module that you can incrementally add to the core game. Some of these are now bundled into an essential edition, or an essential upgrade and an essential edition.

Admittedly, depending on which base and maybe which expansion you acquire, this could lead to some minor redundancy, but the Viticulture Essential Edition is a great all round game to add to your collection, particularly if you’re not sure whether to splash out on the Tuscany expansion by itself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Out of curiosity, what was Stonemaier's first game?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Jamey Stegmaier
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, thats not Viticulture but Tuscany. @ Shots.

So maybe the review is in the wrong forums?

And TBH while Tuscany has a great lot of ideas, that may be great on their own, Viticulture the Base game was a lot more fun to play, had lots less downtime. The only thing that was a straight improvement was the exchange spot where you can get rid of crappy cards.

It also has nothing to do with legacy at all.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I had thought Euphoria was published before Viticulture. However, they both have the same publishing year, so I could be remembering incorrectly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From his designer page "...in late 2011 he started developing his first published board game via Kickstarter, Viticulture: The Strategic Game of Winemaking."

Also you were close on your edit, but again his name is Jamey Stegmaier, not Stonemaier.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Viticulture was Jamey's first game. Euphoria the second, Scythe the third and fourth will be Charterstone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Euphoria actually features a card with a picture of Viticulture on it. So, as others have said, it must have come first.

Hi there!

In my group we are usually 4-6 people, and when we are 6 we have serious problems to play a good game (we mostly like euros).

So my question is clear. Do you think this game works well for 6 players? And if it is OK, why do you think the stats reflects that this game is not recommended for 6 players?

Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've played it with six and it works fine. It's not too long and all the meeples on the board look cool.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For me, 4 players is about max. 6 players introduces way too much downtime for the weight of the game. I've played it once at 6 players but probably won't do it again, it extends the game length considerably.

I've been using Medici as a nice 6 player Euro, and since everyone is involved in every turn it doesn't suffer from downtime. Maybe check that out.

Hi,

So we had difficulty with applying some VISITOR cards that where contrary to the rules in the rule book.

Situation:

A player harvested, in summer using the yoke, and then in the winter using harvest. All cool so far. The player then moved to play a winter card that said the player could harvest from two seperate fields--the card name escapes me.

The dispute came up as the player already harvested in both summer and winter, and could not implement the cards benefits as it contradicted the rules.

Another understood that if the card allowed you to do an action (harvest), irrespective of previous moves (two harvests-one in summer and one in winter) then that card play is valid, the card supersede or is just providing the benefit of the card.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No field may be harvested more than once per year, ever. If that player had 3 fields, and one hadn't been harvested yet, the card would be valid, but if all of their fields had already been harvested, the card was unplayable.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1694106:
What is the real difference between the two card decks? Other than when you can play them is there any other difference?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It always seemed to me that the summer deck was more about planting and building, while the winter deck was more about harvesting and fulfilling wine. So it seemed there was a big difference to me, but maybe that was just my perception.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That pretty much sums it up.

Summer visitors concentrate more on the Summer (and Spring w/ Tuscany) actions. Winter visitors concentrate more on Winter (and Fall) actions. There are a few that allow you to do something in the opposite half of the year, but they are the exceptions.

Each time I play Viticulture, I generally play the same basic strategy:
1. Get extra workers.
2. Get green cards
3. Get the advanced field buildings (forget their names).
4. Plant green cards.
5. Harvest.
6. Make wine.
7. Build cellar expansions.
8. Fill orders.

Maybe slight variations each time. I've come close to winning once or twice, and not come close many times. I have not won yet. Most of my plays are with more experienced players. We usually use the base game, although we have used some Tuscany expansions lately, including the new board, which I like.

I have read that other players can win or get lots of points by only filling one order or no orders.

How do you do this? Tasting room? Windmill? Both of them don't look like they will generate that many points.

Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, you can get single points from several sources, including waking up late, selling grapes bonus, Windmill and Tasting Room, filling order bonus, and some yellow and blue cards, etc. If you're getting around 3+ of these points per year, you'll finish the game in the 8th year; it takes a long time to get the wine engine going, so you can beat it if everyone else if going wine. You can still fill an order or two along the way. It's harder if other people also try to do the same thing though.

I'd read somewhere that the pictures on the visitor cards in second edition Viticulture are paintings of the people credited as sponsors on the bottom of the cards. Is this true or was I just seeing things?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Buck: Most of the visitors in Viticulture are based on real people. They were credited by name on the cards in the first edition.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Did they send photos and the artist create cards based on their likeness or was it done in some other manner?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, that's how we did it. We've since moved away from custom art for a few reasons. You can see my original thoughts on the following blog entry, and there's a link at the bottom of it regarding my current thoughts:

So, I like the copy of Viticulture 1.0 that I've had since it came out, but would like to bring it up to speed. Right now, neither the upgrade to 2.0 nor total replacement via the Viticulture Essentials game are available. Is there any word on what scheduling for all this looks like? I mean, I'd love to have the fancy coins and the Tuscany stuff, but at this point I'm just looking to take care of the basics.

Thanks!

Essential edition just sold out from Miniature Market a few days ago. It might still be available from certain sources. Other than that, either but it from a local/BGG sale/auction or wait for the reprint.

The Essential Edition upgrade pack is still available at the Stonemaier Games store ( https://shop.trycelery.com/page/474ecdd8-7dbb-4068-b1e9-4f5d... )

The 1.0 Update pack used to be available, but it appears Jamey's out of stock: http://stonemaier-games.myshopify.com/products/viticulture-1...

A quick google showed there's a few places still selling (including via Amazon) the 1.0 update pack, but for stupidly expensive prices.

I'm a 37-year-old Dutch guy with a 36-year-old Polish girlfriend. She indulges me by playing games together, and we do not shy away from confrontation at the table. Also, away from the table
She's currently staying over at my place because she broke a bone in her foot and needs some help getting around. Having an invalid in the house is great for playing games, as she can’t run away to do something else.

I bought Viticulture secondhanded this Saturday at a small Dutch convention, in combination with Tuscany and Euphoria ('the Stonemaier special') I got it based on me enjoying Scythe and hearing good things about it through the grapevine. I also got it because I can't resist a bargain. After arriving back home again and being scorned for buying games, she admitted that she liked the theme of Viticulture and would like to try it. I wisely refrained from mentioning anything about stereotypes about Polish people and alcohol, nor women and wine.

So on Sunday after dinner we sat down for Viticulture. These are our findings:
The game is easy to learn: everything you need to know is on the board. If you've played other worker placement games, you can pretty much start right away after a quick scan of the rules. I will not go into the details of the rules here, I'll just say that the goal is to gain points by planting vines, growing grapes, crushing them like the skull and spirit of your opponent, making wine and fulfilling orders. You achieve this all by putting your people to work efficiently.

The component quality is excellent. Nice sturdy materials, a choice of boards with and without explanatory text. Top notch, it’s the Stonemaier standard.
The game itself is extremely good, one of the best I've played this year. I guess the best word for it, is 'pleasant'. It’s got such a feel of serenity over it. Managing your workers between seasons gives you interesting choices. The visitors add spice and surprise. The level of interaction is just right: visitor cards often have an effect on your opponent and you might want to keep an eye on each other’s plans: a well-placed worker can disrupt your opponent’s plans for a year.

The bickering factor was pretty low. Sure, we were in each other's way sometimes, but with the big worker that enables you to take an action that's already been taken by your opponent, you could still do most of the things you wanted to do. I think I only got sworn at when I managed to complete big orders.

I own a lot of games, and many I’ve only played once or not even that. After completing our first game of Viticulture, we agreed we’d give it another go very soon. The plan is to play the regular version again next time, then start adding the Tuscany stuff. I’m hoping she’ll agree to add the mama’s and papa’s next time already.

Heartily recommended!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is one of my favorite games- precisely because my wife enjoys it so much. There is plenty of strategy involved, and multiple ways to gain victory points. The tight economy makes you really consider your decisions.

Tuscany opens up even more possibilities! The expanded board and the mamas and the papas are the best modules- but the additional summer and winter visitor cards are also great-
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is easily one of my favorite worker placement games, You are right, because of the Grande worker, and the myriad of choices, bickering tends to be very low (compared, with, say
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
). It's very relaxing, perhaps not as relaxing as
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
or
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
, but still a great game to chill with after a stressful day.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Viticulture plays well with two, though I think it gets more interesting with 4 or so. The expansions help the game out without "fixing" everything like some expansions do. We like adding one or two things in each time. We always use Mommas and Poppas as it starts you out and helps you to approach the start differently each time.

What I really like about the game is that there are lots of ways to score points - I've nearly won before without fulfilling a single order card (much harder to do in 2-player, but an option in 4-player games).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You're funny. And I'd love to read more reviews from you.
I'll have to look for your avatar/name.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't think that's a factor I've seen mentioned before about our games, but I'm happy to hear that Viti didn't add much to your bickering .

Thank you for taking the time to post.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that you have played once, I highly recommend the Tuscany board in which you play all four seasons and have more choices for worker placement

I also highly recommend you play sometime with 4 players - lots of players getting in each others' way makes for an interesting game
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We've played it again (with some bickering), just the base game. She won this time, I was trying to gain points by using the mill and the tasting table. It was close, but she beat me fair and square. I tried the Automa a couple of times (won the fourth game) with the Mama's and Papa's but I'm not allowed to do that anymore as it gives me an unfair advantage.

Thanks for your comments and feedback, I'm sure we'll play this a lot more!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This means that I've achieved my goal of making the solo game similar enough to the multiplayer game that playing against the Automa makes you better at the multiplayer game.

That makes me a happy camper .

I have a copy of Viticulture Essential Edition, and one of Tuscany original Collector's Edition with metal coins. Someone threw as many of the components as would fit (it's surprisingly most of them) from Tuscany into the Viticulture box, and now it's a discorganized, jumbled mess. Fortunately, nothing is open, but I need help figuring out what I have duplicates of, and seperating out the doubles, perhaps to sell or trade individually, or as a set. I would prefer not to open them if possible. A few things can be figured out from the components list, such as Momas and Papas, and the field cards/property tiles (they are the same), but much of the rest is really confusing (some visitors from Essential Edition Viticulture and Advanced Visitors from Tuscany, for example). Many items are the same cards, but it's nearly impossible to figure out what is the same and what is not without opening the decks, which I would prefer not to do with the duplicates if I can avoid it. I shouldn't need any of the second edition errata stuff from Tuscany, nor should I need to replace any cards from Essential Edition with Tuscany cards, as Essential edition came after and includes those changes. But I do want to add all of the Tuscany conpenents that are not in the Essential Edition Viticulture, and remove any duplicates. Can anyone help with a detailed comparison of components, and help figure out how to identify duplicates without having to open everything and compare card by card? Progress using the components lists in each of the two rulebooks is confusing, slow, and sometimes innacurate, because the Tuscany book suggests replacing cards that have already been updated for the Viticulture Essential Edition. And Viticulture Essential Edition doesn't differentiate between base cards and expansion cards in the rulebook or component list.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. If I don't hear anything and fail to sort things out on my own with the decks sealed, I'll just open the decks and go from there.

Thanks!

I'd like to apologise in advance if this has been covered before somewhere. I did my best to read thoroughly before asking.

There is a card that allows the opponent to retrieve a worker and you get 1 VP. Let's assume it's winter and the opponent had already passed the previous turn. The he receives a new worker. Can she use this worker even if she passed? Or the worker is actually lost? In the latter case, of course, the best move would be not to retrieve the worker. I just wanted to make sure what the rule would be.

Thanks a lot.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Essential Edition rulebook has this sentence on the top of page 7:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So the answer will be no, she cannot use the new worker if she has passed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your opponent gets no advantage from retrieving, so almost certainly should not do so.

I play many time this week with my freind and we play tuscany since the game issue and one thing still bother me about this game is almost 70% of winner win without planting any grape. Sometimes they even sell all land and keep getting a point from selling a land track which compare to other player who doesn't compete on this track because they keep it fir their grape or not have enough action to spend on this selling land. Many other ways "no planting grape" player get points is via testing room which they get wine from trading action for grape juice in crush pad and covert it to wine, which require only few action compare to plant on their own land. They also use trading technique to get grape and wine for winter visitor and get a lot of point from card like "fionse" or "judge".
There point increse steadily every season while grape planter have to search for their grape search for the order, planting, havesting, make wine which require a lot of actions
Is there anything to win that strategy?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is much, much easier to win simply by planting vines and filling orders than any of the other ays. Especially the way you describe above, which yields 1 point or 2 points per year...
Our games, on average, last 7 years.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Generally I think this happens when people play Viticulture in "multiplayer solitaire" mode. You need to keep an eye on what other people are doing and try to prevent them from taking the "free" VP route, while also generating VP through your chosen strategy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't think this is true, otherwise we wouldn't see the OP's thread being posted so regularly. Neither would there be a need for rule changes such as the one for the Tasting Table. I believe that the game is best won through a balance of taking Wine-related points when you can, but taking "free" points on the off turn when you know you can't make wine points.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It takes considerable luck to win in six years without planting vines in standard (20-point) Viticulture, making the 25 that Tuscany requires is even harder. In 7 years a productive vineyard will usually be able to surpass the no-grape strategy, generally I see at least one vine-planter in the 27-28 point range in 7 years.

However, many players seem to need 8-10 years to make a vineyard and get the wine orders out. for them, strategies without graps can seem to dominate. They are a very reliable way to end the game in 7-8 years.

With all due respect to AndurilFOTW, the answer to your conundrum is to play more efficiently when making wines. There is no one sure way to do this, but one suggestion: harvest the grapes and get lots of wine orders before you make wine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
People in my group complain that the only way to win is to plant grapes and sell the right wines at the right time.

They are mostly right. You will not win in the games we play without making wine. The winner is the player that can make win and adapt one other tactic to also get victory points (be it tasting room, or planting vines for points or other once a year point tools). Also having the right visitor cards to get those extra 3 to 5 points on the last turn is also critical.

If I am playing in a game and none of the other players are planting or selling wine, I am in heaven as I can then double plant, double harvest, make more win, and sell them for extra VP.

The average score of the games I play is around 30 to 34. Getting to 25 points in 7 years will not win you the game, you need to plan on a larger jump (unless you can get to 25 points the year before everyone else is ready for their last push).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would concur. Even playing Tuscany, there is simply no way to win without making wines. It is true that, as the OP suggests, early on in the game you can take the lead by scraping together these small VP actions. But there is no doubt that the winner will make gigantic leaps at the end game with their wine making engine before you can secure a win that way. At least, if people know what they are doing.

Even if you did manage to remain competitive until the endgame, you will see the eventual winner vault past you in the last turn. It is not uncommon to see people putting down 7 to 10 VP (or even more occasionally) in the last turn with their wine making strategy. You simply cannot compete with that kind of power at the end game if you are grabbing a measly 1, 2 or 3 still.

However, paying attention to these small VP caches can often be the difference between the victor at the end. So they are very important.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't think its possible to win only by selling/buying field or grapes. You dont have to deliver orders, but planting vines helps. I just had a game of 5 players, 6 years - where I delivered only one order (white wine for 3 v.p.+1 v.p. for beeng the first that year), and the rest of the points got from working with visitors.

Apologies in advance as I am sure this will have already been asked, but i've done a bit of trawling and can't seem to find the answer.

I have the Viticulture 2nd edition and also Tuscany 1st edition, do I gain anything from purchasing the Viticulture Essential Edition or upgrade pack? I think the autonoma cards are only in that? Is there anything else?

From what I read the EE basically just adds Tuscany expansions to Viticulture which I likely already have?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No. Enjoy your copy and game on. Absolutely zero reason to buy the EE.

Only if you want the matte version of the extended board.

So, I got the Complete Edition of Viticulture (2nd Edition) and Tuscany, during its KS in 2014.

a couple of weeks ago, I purchased the Essential Upgrade pack for several reasons. The property cards and the fact that all the visitors cards had the same layout. No more advanced or titles is cursive, all had the same look and the unnecessary visitors were already removed.

I unsleeved all my Complete Edition visitors and replaced them with the ones from the Upgrade pack. We haven't played it since.

Yesterday we wanted to play a game of Viticulture again and I noticed something strange. All the original vine and wine order cards were still flat, like they were unused (but in reality have been played with like 30 times). The new visitors deck (from the Upgrade pack) were all incredibly warped, which had never been played with yet. I checked the original visitors cards (that I stored in the Tuscany box) and surely they were all flat as well.

Were the cards from the Upgrade pack a different quality?
Just checking if anyone else who had the 2nd Edition and also bought the Upgrade Pack (for whatever reason) has the same issue?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yep, I have the same. However, my experience was from the beginning with the upgrade pack, though I put it down to the overly tight shrink-wrapping of the cards. They are noticeably "domed". I hope it doesn't get worse!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wow. So it's not just me then.

It's a pity as I love this game so much, but it somehow got a little bit tainted.

Warning: RANT:

The Complete Collector's Box was supposed to be complete, no more expansion in a while, etc etc... When we receive it, there is an error on the property tiles. There's a fix though, with stickers.
Not a year later, Essential Edition. The updated visitors cards (layout) and property tiles (now large cards, which are much better) are only available if you purchase the Upgrade Pack. Which now seems like the cards are warping.

A few months after that, another expansion announced with updated cards that are in the Complete Set/Upgrade Pack. If you want the updated cards, you need to purchase the expansion. Another "error" though, the expansion cards are slightly bigger/wider and slightly different color. I haven't purchased it yet, hoping there will be a second print for it, which fixes those "errors".

Now there is going to be a new version of Tuscany (Essential Edition). Which includes a 9 card promo (which will be available eventually at the Geekstore) and the Tuscany Extended Board will be the same material as the base game board. So, the completionist in me ofcourse wants that as well.

It sucks I love this game so much and think Jamey did a great job during the KS and I'd like to support him/them, but there are a lot of small errors/mistakes adding up/being fixed and updates to this game. It's starting to feel like the next Carcassonne/Catan (slightly exaggerating, or am I? )

I also feel like Jamey is more and more getting annoyed at those people (the complainers/completionists). If you bought the Moor Expansion and can't handle the cards being slightly bigger, tough luck. Instead of trying to work with solutions or just telling us when a next batch will be printed and if we'd be able to tell the second print apart from the first when purchasing, I feel like he's keeping all that info vague, because he doesn't want to deal with the heavy complainers. (Yes, I'm aware I'm one of those )

Now, I did get the Upgrade Pack and those cards are bowed. I wonder how Jamey will respond to this. Will there be replacements. Will there be a second printing and you'll just have to purchase it again. Or will nothing be done and once again, tough luck and deal with it, because there are so many who aren't bothered by it.

DISCLAIMER: not angry. not trying to be rude. just disappointed. because again, I love this game.

Where can I purchase the stickers for the property tiles?

No one else with this problem?

I wonder if it's all Essential editions or just the Upgrade packs or just some copies. The warping is pretty extreme though.

I also wonder if Jamey is aware of this issue, or, dare I ask, cares?

Hilo ID 1602470:
Do you build the yoke? If so, why?

In my games (~10 of which I've won ~9 of them), I've never built the Yoke. With the grande worker I generally find it pretty easy to navigate the main board to get to what I want. I actually vastly prefer the game at even numbers of players because it makes for more interesting decisions from this perspective. Disclaimer, some of this almost certainly has to be quality of competition related. Thus, I'm curious as to the prevalence of the Yoke in other people's games.

Jamey: if you see this, can you explain some of the thought process behind the Yoke from a design perspective? Obviously uprooting is a remedial task, so outside of that, in the best of situations it provides more accessible harvesting. Was harvest seen a more significant "choke point" in the Viticulture wine-making process than the other steps?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I do! So I can always know for sure that I will be able to harvest every year. Playing with a higher player count can take that away from you very easily.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've built the yoke in quite a few games, because it can be useful, plus it's cheap compared to other structures.

a) you can harvest during summer (definitely a key point)
b) you can harvest when all the 'Harvest' spots are blocked and you've already used your Grande worker, or:
c) you can harvest a second field if there's no more 'Harvest' spots or you missed on out on the +1 bonus.

Uprooting I have rarely done, but it's possible that doing uproot/plant when you have the Windmill is a good way to earn an extra VP every year.

Receantly I bougt Viticulture (1st edition) and Tuscany(Prima editio). In one of the boxes I found set of stickers and I still can't figure out where should I put them. Can anybody advise me ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not 100% sure but I think it is one of the answers below....probably number 3

From the Viticulture & Tuscany FAQ


1.Is there a misprint on the property tiles?
There is a mistake on the property tiles (not a misprint–it’s my fault, not the printer’s). Each of the lira amounts on the property numbers should be the same on the front and the back. For example, you can sell the 5-lira property tile to gain 5 lira, and then you can buy it back later if you want for 5 lira. However, the punchboard got flipped, and the back of the 5-lira property says that it would cost you 7 lira to buy it back. The situation is reversed for the 7-lira property tile. You can fix the back of the tiles using stickers (see Property Tiles printout), buy the stickers for $1 on BGG, request the stickers on our replacement parts form, or just remember that the numbers should match up. It’s very rare that a player would buy back a property after selling it, but it does happen occasionally.

And

2.If I got the stickers to update my first-edition Viticulture vineyard mats, where do the stickers go?
See below for the second-edition vineyard mats to see where to place those stickers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.What are the stickers for?
There is a sheet of stickers in the box with all of the different icons in the game and different numerical increments. This was a Kickstarter stretch goal that is not actually needed for the game, but after you’ve played the game a number of times, you might want to customize your copy by changing some of the numbers on the cards, board, or player mats. Perhaps you might have a Risk: Legacy-style house rule that allows the winner to change one icon on one of the player mats. The player mats are double sided, so you can always keep one side the same, and the back side could be different (like the different player mats in 7 Wonders).

Hi,

After the announcement of Essential Tuscany, I went ahead and ordered the Arboriculture/Formaggio expansion pack from the A La Carte website to have the full experience.

However, my package arrived without the extra glass beads (I did receive the new board, even though I didn't order it - so I call that a win). My question is, are the extra glass beads there just in case, or will I run out if I only have the ones provided with Essential Viticulture?

Just need to know if I need to supply some extra tokens to be used as proxies...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You'll most likely never run out of glass tokens. I've played many 6-player games and we never used all of them. So you are good.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heh, I did exactly the same things and had the same question. I was going to try playing a game or two and see. Thus far, with the base game there's always been plenty of beads available, so I was thinking it probably would not be an issue. Even if the beads run out, I figure I could proxy something in for a bit.

The other question I had on this was for Formaggio, how do the stars work? Like with the extra beads, there were no wooden stars included. That one also seems to somewhat depend on the Tuscany extended board & influence map. I was again thinking I could proxy something in (glass beads) for where the stars are used, but am not sure how to handle the map interaction.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Never used the Formaggio module so I can't comment on that but as for the stars and the influence map, I don't think glass beads will work because you need to be able to distinguish the tokens by player color so you can determine who has the most influence in each region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the moment that's a moot point for me. I don't have the expanded map (yet--waiting for Tuscany: Essential). I will only be using Formaggio & reading the rules PDF it appears to be at least somewhat linked to the expanded map. If I have to wait for the T:EE to get into my collection, then so be it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Without Tuscany's extended board, there's not much point to the stars. You could make a house rule that says that you can draw a card or take $1 each time you get the star bonus action, and that's relatively close to the actual benefit of the influence map.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I haven't tried playing with more than 4 players, so I'm actually not sure, whether it would be an issue.

You can fill out our replacement form to get the missing glass beads shipped to you - and gratz on the free board .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As noted on the store page, the Formaggio expansion is dependent on the Extended Board on which the stars are used. I'm sorry if you don't have the Extended Board, then you'd have to house rule to use Formaggio.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I appreciate the offer, but I got the free board, I'd feel kind of petty asking for the beads too. Worse case scenario, I'll just proxy with something else.

Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's very kind of you, thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No problem at all. I missed that before ordering. That said, in the end it won't matter as I plan to buy T:EE once it's out. I grabbed these to makes sure I have them (Jamey said he had only 9 copies); these two modules are ones that I am highly interested in and sad that the Essential Edition wasn't getting. So, long story short (yeah, too late): I'll play the Arboriculture module, and Formaggio can either sit dormant until I buy T:EE, or use something like the house rule concepts below.

Going over the rules, I may be able to simply ignore all the influence map parts & just have the Make Cheese action allow a player to activate a Cheese Expert spot. It may be as simple as that, or possibly assign a Lira cost to make it more like building a structure. Then the effect would simply be adding VP via selling cheese on its own or adding to filled orders. As for trading cows, simply use the Sell Grapes spot that gets replaced with Trade One For One on the extended map.

Anyway, enough tanget in this thread. Suffice it to say, I am not unhappy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm happy that you're not unhappy .

I don't know how many times I've played, but it's over 60. I just can't seem to justify building the windmill. I thought, maybe if it allowed more benefits, especially late in the game. I thought, thematically, the power generated by the wind would improve the irrigation to the fields. Thus if you have the windmill and the irrigation, each field gains +1 limit for planting (no change in £X for flipping). Thoughts?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The moor visitors cards address the weakness of the windmill and tasting room very well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the game I played over the weekend, both players that started with the windmill came in first and second, by a wide margin over third. It's possible the items aren't connected, but a free 4-5 points per game is a rather nice bonus for the money invested in the windmill.

Hilo ID 1595586:
I have only played the game once, but during that game I found myself unable to draw any white vine cards. Several tries at drawing vine cards came up red, and several draws at the orders deck continued to give me white and sparkling wine orders to fill.
I managed to score points in other ways (visitor cards, bonuses, etc), and late in the game I eventually managed to find white vine cards. The fact that I came in 2nd place is a testament to this game's nicely-balanced multiple paths for gaining victory points.

However, it occurred to me that there might be an opportunity for some extra player interaction and a way to try to dig out of such a situation: Enable players to sell grapes to opponents.
Perhaps the "sell grapes" action could allow a player to sell a grape to the bank for its base lira value, or to an opponent for a negotiated lira value.

Do any of the existing expansions offer this grape-selling opportunity? Has anyone tried this as a variant? Or would it break the balance somehow, or simply never be used since it would help an opponent too much (although the negotiated price would theoretically offset that imbalance)?

(also posted in
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
as it would apply to the updated version of the game as well)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is very interesting.

However, coins aren't worth any points. So mid-late game there's no incentive to sell your grapes to an opponent. You're giving up future points for coins that have minimal value at that point in the game.

The only time I think it would make sense to make that deal from the seller's perspective is early in the game. But, early in the game a player would still be willing to try and draw vine cards to get white grapes instead of buying them from an opponent.

Very interesting idea, but I don't think it would be utilized often.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nick: Thanks for your question. It can be frustrating when your vines and wine orders don't line up. Tuscany fixes this issue by allowing players to sell grapes for other grapes or sell cards for other cards. Note that this exchange, like all other exchanges in Viticulture, is with the supply, not with other players, as that kind of trading could slow down the game too much.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuscany fixed that issue with the trade area that allows you to swap stuff around. I would be concerned that selling grapes to other players would degenerate to "take advantage of the newbie"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks all for your input, I didn't know that about Tuscany. And thank you Jamey for your reply and for your design point about potentially slowing the game down. Looking forward to trying the game again!

Hilo ID 1591445:
Two areas of discussion in our game today. Want to be sure we implemented rules correctly.

1. Crushpad ...aging grapes is not limited, right? Only limit is for wine in the cellar.

2. Summer Visitor: Architect gives an option to gain a VP for each 4L building already built. We read as strictly 4L cost, not equal to or greater than 4 lira. Was that correct?

Thanks in advance!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are correct in both cases! The 2nd card is much more useful when using the structures expansion from Tuscany.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Val: Can you give a little more detail about the crushpad portion of the question? I can interpret that in a few different ways, so I want to make sure you get the right answer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1591437:
Situation: 3 fields, 2 have low level white grapes only; play a card to harvest up to 3 fields with a 2VP bonus if you do 3. Already low grapes in crush pad for white. Harvesting 3 fields would result in one of the solo white fields yielding a grape that would be downgraded beyond 1, i.e. no room to place it. We ruled that the field could not be harvested as there was no place to put it, and thus no bonus was granted. The alternative is that the field WAS harvested, but no grape was obtained. Thus the VP points should have been granted.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's a great question about a very niche situation. I don't think I've ever answered it before, so I'm open to opinions. I'll say for now that you did harvest the field--it counts as a harvest since you did perform the harvest (you just didn't have room for all of the grape tokens, which happens). So you would get the bonus.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In retrospect, I agree. I suppose since you don't get to keep the grape, that doesn't mean you didn't harvest it. It wasn't critical in the end game VP totals, so no harm.

Hi!

In my last session with the game, one visitor card was played (don't remember the exact name of the card and I don't have the card next to me here) but I do remember the wording of the card, which confused all of us. It said something along the lines of "...... or upgrade to the next level cellar at regular price".

What does that actually mean? I guess what really struck me as odd was the use of "upgrade" in this sense. It would be clear if it said "build", but "upgrade" sounded like it should offer a better deal than simply paying 6 lira for the large cellar or 4 for the medium if you don't already have it. We played the card as paying the difference between the two cellars (i.e. 2 lira from medium to large cellar) but that doesn't sit right with me either.

Clarification on this card will be much appreciated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If I had to guess (without going to grab the card to be sure) I think the point of that second option to upgrade is that it allows you to build the next level of your cellar without placing a worker on the "Build a Structure" space, like if it's already got someone else's worker on it but you really need that next cellar this round.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm not claiming expertise, but I believe having a card to do this provides an alternative using the build space. If one is in the position to play two cards or if it is a winter card, then I think it provides a substantial benefit. Otherwise, access to the build area would deliver the same.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Upgrade" is used in the same way that "build" is used. It's just a different word for your cellar because you're making your existing cellar better, and you have to build the cellars in order--medium, then large.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the clarifications~ Appreciate it.

I guess I just read too much into the choice of wording here
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what happen if existing cellar already large cellar?
Do this mean that card cannot played? or just automatically get the Victory point mentioned?

My Viticulture is KS ver and have visitor card that mention, upgrade your cellar than get VP.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edwin: If you already have a large cellar, you can't play a card that would upgrade it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Jamey,
On my structure mat I have the “Studio" which gives me 1 VP whenever I build a structure.
Would a cellar "upgrade" from a visitor card be considered as build and gives me 1 VP?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JB: Indeed, you would gain 1 VP for building ("upgrading to") a bigger cellar.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you Jamey!

Hello,

I know Mr Jamie Stagmeier is always around this forum so my question is for him or someone else that can answer!

- I bought Viticulture EE and noticed today that I have 1 headless Purple Worker! Is there anyway I can get a new purple worker?

If you go to the website, I believe there is a form to fill out to request replacement parts. I also needed one worker replaced back in the day and the service was excellent!

Hi,
Looking to finally get this to the table tomorrow for the first time and the one space I'm not sure on from the rule book is the winter "train an additional worker". I get that you need to wait until the start of the next year to use them, but are they only available for that following year or for every year from there on out until the end of the game?
Many thanks for answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The trained workers are yours for the rest of the game. The gray worker from the wake up track is only for that year.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cheers for clearing that up. It seemed too expensive a cost just for one year!
Thanks for the speedy reply
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Happy to help. Have fun!

I was thinking of introducing my in-laws to Viticulture (with a few bits of Tuscany thrown in). They are new to WP games and will need 1+ game(s) to learn their way around the wine-making business, and therein lies the problem: It's no fun if I just crush them. Similarly, it's also less fun if I have to intentionally make suboptimal plays to accommodate the in-laws.

I am toying with the idea of handicapping myself by exchanging my Grande with a regular worker - or perhaps doing away with the third worker altogether. Has anyone tried something similar and how did it go?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When I'm teaching new players, I go out of my way to suggest strategies and point out powerful combos. I'll also explain my plays as I go to show them why I made that choice. I rarely end up winning these games, but that's kind of the point.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Similarly, I coach them during the first couple of years.
Get that position.
Buy a cottage.
Make sure you have enough money to train an extra worker.
Etc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are all good suggestions, and Holger, it's nice of you to look out for the people you teach. My first thought was that you could try a strategy that heavily deviates from normal strategies, but the problem with that is the new players are going to look at the way you play as a roadmap for how they should play.

So a twist on that would be to play very straightforward until you complete one cycle of the game. Show the other players through the way you play how to get a building, plant a vine, harvest the vine, crush grapes, build a cellar (if needed), and fill a wine order.

After they see you follow that cycle, you can try some zany/fun strategy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great suggestion. I intend to teach the game that way this weekend.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the replies, everyone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That is my concern, too. Now, Jason and Aernout's suggestions are sound, and teaching a game will often require some level of hand-holding, but I guess I am really looking for a solution that will allow them to explore the game in their own pace without me playing the first few rounds for them.

I suppose there's also a good point in keeping my Grande and demonstrate how it can be used to access a spot (sans bonus) that's already been taken. The first 1-2 round(s) will have to be a tour around the vineyard, then, and the following rounds I'll try and pursue the odd strategy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many good teaching ideas offered.

If their age or health creates any retention problems, it may help to show them a video as a refresher or send them the link in advance.
More importantly, it's time with family; the quality of the interaction is what matters. So, if you spend more time talking to each other during the first few rounds while they explore options, it's all good.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can start the game at -5 VP; you can limit your workers to 4; you can set a higher VP total that YOU must reach to end / win the game; you can take no bonuses; you can limit card total to lower than 7 (pick a number); you can increase the cost of all structures by £1-2 or more. All these would be applied to to experienced players and none for beginners. I usually play 1-2 games with everyone's cards face up and then explain different strategies and choices, but allowing them to make the final decision. I also will explain all possible outcomes to different actions and consequences, good or bad. I especially teach the art of blocking the opponent and denial of actions. I would really delay special workers till they've played a bunch. I have nearly eliminated mindless TV time with this game. It's a much better use of family time.

When I first saw the box art, I was charmed. I knew Viticulture would find its way into my collection. My maternal grandparents came from Italy, so, of course we grew up with a garden, a grapevine, and Grand Pap's wine. Several of our neighbors also made table wine. What a natural fit! Or perhaps it was those trips to wineries in France, Germany, and Herman, Missouri that made this feel intuitive and easy to grasp.

Tonight my monthly group at Panera (Hilary, Marshall, and Val) tried Viticulture and it was a first play for all three of us. Two of us had watched a video and I had also read the rules.

The set-up was easy and quicker than one might think. We selected Mama and Papa cards, gathered resources, determined first player, and then placed our roosters. Thus, we became winemakers.

As 1st player, Marshall collected a wine order card, I gathered an extra vine card, and Hilary took the extra worker. Our first years were spent with H and M selecting vine cards and planting vines, while I was building trellises and irrigation system, and and we all gave tours to raise money. Winters held little work those years, sometimes producing a Lira, sometimes allowing a visitor card to be played.

One summer visitor offered me a particular boon: 9 Lira in exchange for VP debt. I took it and ran to build and train a new worker. In the Winter, I gathered orders. I was slow to plant. At first I thought this helped me, and it should have...BUT my orders were mostly for white wines while my grapes were mainly reds.

All of us, as innocents in this business, made the error of forgetting to build the oxen yoke for the cart. Harvesting had to wait an extra year. In years 3-7 we all corrected that shortfall, made wine and expanded our cellars. H did a great job of expanding her force, M expanded his options by collecting many cards and much income. I built and trained an showed them the value of playing two visitor cards at once. Needless to say, I didn't get to do that again!

We were shy of meeting the end game goal (20 points) when the folks at Panera politely asked us to wrap it up. When we stopped, I was in the lead with 12 points, Hilary with 10, and Marshall with 8. I was also ahead on the residual track (2L vs 1 L), but Marshall had far more money and Hilary had all six workers. My strength was building infrastructure and my drawback was too many red wines...so, it was still anyone's game. And I think that balance combined with its intuitive, "it just makes sense" nature is what ensures this will quickly be back on the table.

Even though we did not finish it as intended. We all felt we liked the game and would play it again. Once I hit about a dozen plays, I'm going to try to form a regular group for Tuscany.

One final comment: The quick reference / summary page satisfied most questions and player demands to read or check rules. Kudos to Jamey and everyone on the production end for including that card.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm quite surprised that time was an issue with Viticulture. My group's first playthrough took well under two hours, and that was with five players. Now you've played once, though, you should have a handle on the mechanics. Most games end in year 6, year 7 at most, with the first small orders generally being filled in year 3. Games will then take about 60-80 minutes.

One point I should make: you don't need to build the Yoke to harvest. The Yoke gives you an extra harvesting space that only you can use (including in Summer, which can be key for timing), but you can always use the ones on the board.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1579831:
I had a situation this weekend where I had a white grape in the two grape position, then harvested two different fields each with white grapes of 1. The first grape obviously goes in the one position. But what about the other grape? I am assuming I am playing it right...all of the white grapes on one field are combined to form the grape on your board (for instance, if on field with space for 5, you can harvest a one white grape card and a two grape card but it converts to a three grape token on your board.

It also happened later in the game whenever I harvested off of the yoke space and then again in the winter time in the harvest area. I would end up with three white grape tokens lined up on position one.

Any help would be appreciated. Couldn't find anything in the rulebook (I have Viticulture: Essential Edition).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you harvest a field, you add up all the grapes in that field, and place one white and/or one red grape token on your board. This is as you describe. So a field with two cards, one with White 1 and one with White 2 would produce a White 3 token on the crush pad.

In the situation where you already had White 2 on the crush pad, and then harvested a field with a White 1, that adds a White 1 token to the crush pad. Harvesting a second field with White 1 would be pointless[1] as there's no room on the crush pad for another White 1, so the token would effectively be lost (the grapes aren't ripe enough).

As for harvesting with the Yoke in summer, always remember that each field can only be harvested once PER YEAR, no matter how you use the harvest action. (There might be a visitor card that overrules this, but that would be the only exception).


[1] Unless that same field had some red grapes you could add to the red side of the crush pad.

I really like the game, but it plays quite long and takes a while to get going. Is there a way to start out with some cards or maybe grapes to get the engine going quicker? This is playing with Tuscany extended board with Mama/Papa and special workers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is a slow build up, but I find it short when you get used to it. Considering that the solo variant plays for only 7 years and you win if you reach 20 points, you could always limit the number of years.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was a four-player game with two new players.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mamas and Papas *is* pretty much the way to quick-start - you'll start with more stuff (structures/cards/money) than in the original base game.

The other module you might want is the properties, because by selling one of them in the first year, you'll get a boost of extra money to be used to build structures or train new workers.

I played a 2 player with my girlfriend on the weekend using properties, mamas and papas, advanced visitors, new visitors and moor visitors (so basically, the Essential Edition + Moor visitors) and I didn't manage to even *plant* any grapes until the third year because of blocked spaces and visitor cards that didn't really help me. That being said, when she got to 20 points to end the game, I wasn't far behind - I'd got to 15, and had a 5-point wine order that would have taken me just one more year to fill. So it was still a close game, despite the slow start.

You could always create a variant where each player, in addition to what their mamas and papas give them, gets one of each card (vine, wine order, summer and winter visitor) so there's more choices for them to make on the first few years.

A number of people have asked for a full list of visitor cards in Viticulture, Tuscany, and Moor Visitors, so I typed it out here:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mCRAuf99t6tuiPRWHbaf...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Jamey!

Are there instructions on how to build the visitor decks given all the different editions?

For instance, if I have the 2nd Edition and Tuscany (from the Complete Collector's Edition) and now Moor Visitors, which visitor cards should I be using? I read something about only using Advanced visitors and some cards being changed, but I can't remember all the details and where I read them.

Thank for such great support.

---Matt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew: Sure, there are instructions about Advanced Visitors in that section of the Tuscany rulebook. As for Moor Visitors, you can just shuffle them all in.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Jamey.

To check, are there any cards from Tuscany that I should add to my deck from Viticulture EE?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have Viticulture EE, all of the visitors cards in Tuscany are already there. However, if you often play 5-6 player games and find your visitor decks running out, you could shuffle all the Tuscany cards in to make two big mega decks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, no problem with having duplicates. Good to know.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I see it as a slight problem. Certain cards are very useful in certain situations, and the other players have to stretch to keep up. If those cards would come up twice, they become too influential for my taste.

Just shuffle the discard pile.

You can tell by the box top. The Essential Edition has those words right under Viticulture. Otherwise it's a second edition if it has a red stamp on the box top that says "now with grande workers."

In a solo game, just like in a 2p game, no bonus spots are available. By using the tokens, you get the bonus for a specific action.
So for instance, you can harvest an extra field or play an extra summer visitor etc.

Sorry I couldn't help more, hopefully someone else will be able to answer more concretely soon

Russ
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It contains the automota deck, so it adds what you need to play solo.

It upgrades your game to the "new base" game, as well. You won't have all of the bits of Tuscany (like the extra board, which i hear is really good), but you'll get a few of them.

When the card says " build a structure" do you still have to pay the lira?

I don't have the card in front of me, but in general the answer is "yes." By playing this card you get a build a structure action without having to put a worker in the build a structure action. Cards that say "build a structure" are often followed by "at a $2 discount" or the like, so if it doesn't say "for free" then you still have to cough up the .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's how I saw it, just wanted to be sure before tonight's game night. Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, unless the card says otherwise. The benefit of the card is that you get to use a Visitor space to trigger a Build action, which is a pretty good benefit on its own, don't you think? Of course, some cards also provide some additional benefit (such as a discount, or pay with VP, whatever) but they all state this.

To keep within the great theme how are the individual player boards described. Are they a winery, Vineyard or something else?

Is Viticulture a community venture whereby each player has to share limited resources to make there 'Vineyard' the best in the region?

I'd like to jump into Viticulture, but I'm not sure how. The nice Kickstarter wine box, the Second edition retail box, expansions? Aside from the cool box, why would I want the fancy Kickstarter edition? Is it better if I go with just the basic retail edition and add the expansion later?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Viticulture Essential Edition is the base game, the second edition is no longer available. Get that first and if you like it and want more depth get Tuscany the expansion.

I'm not sure what you mean by Kickstarter box. Do you mean the collectors edition?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I agree with katanan, I'd go with Viticulture Essential Edition.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I obsessed over this exact same question when I was looking to buy Viticulture. I ended up going with the Essential Edition. It gets me all the base game play plus some expansions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Essential Edition worked for me.

Liked it well enough to then add Tuscany. It cost me more than did Essential Edition. Though there are elements of Tuscany that I do not use, the expanded board and specialized workers made Tuscany worthwhile.

For introducing new players, Essential Edition is plenty.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As far as I know there is no other option at this point, the Second Edition went out of print last year and the Essential Edition is the new base game. The question comes up quite a bit but a quick search at online retailers will turn up no results for the Second Edition so I'm always confused to see why people still think it's available. There needs to be big bold text somewhere that says "Essential Edition is the new base game".

Unless you are talking about buying an (absurdly priced) Collector's Edition from the marketplace.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would got with the KS box, Viticulture is a good game but the Tuscany expansion makes it a great game. And if it turns out you don't like it, you won't have any trouble selling it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most listings I've seen for the Collector's Edition are almost twice the cost of buying Viticulture Essential Edition and Tuscany separately (after factoring in shipping too). For me at least that's a little too much of a premium for the wooden box and the metal coins. If you can get the Collector's Edtition for close to the original price it would be a no brainer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I bought the Essential Edition and Tuscany. I also bought the metal coins with the original Treasure Chest that they put out.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Would recommend the Essential Edition. It gives you enough to chew on and help you decide whether you like the game or not. It appears Tuscany Essential is going to be made soon and probably will include the extended board, so no reason to rush Tuscany unless you want the expansions that the designer felt weren't good enough to continue publishing.

The metal coins are amazing, though, so you should get those while they last. Jamey said they just found a bunch in storage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for all the answers guys! I was considering the Kickstarter Collector's edition for around $200, but I think I'll just go with the Essential edition and await the Essential Tuscsny. Where can I get some of those just-found metal coins?

Hi all,

So I'd really like to replace the Meeples in the game with miniatures of farmers or workers. When it comes to buying miniatures, however, just about everything tends to be fantasy. The best alternative seems to picking up these HO scale model train figures of workers and then painting them and gluing them to a base so they'll stand.

http://www.amazon.com/Model-Power-5790-Workers-Unpainted/dp/...

I really like using miniatures with board games as I think it helps with the immersion in the theme.

Anyone have any experience with this or tips?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have you seen the meeples for this game? They're all custom little grape farmers. Not quite miniature quality but a far bit better than the standard ones from Carcassonne and Keyflower. Tuscany takes it one step further and includes even more custom meeples for the special workers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have the Essentials Edition. All the meeples are general colored Carcassonne style meeples.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you ever decide to go through with Tuscany, note that there are Special workers that change the appearance of standard workers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You sure about that? I'm almost certain that these are custom meeples shaped like field workers, including an oversized Grande worker, not generic meeples... At least they were in previous editions. Take a closer look.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now, if you are refering to any kind of wooden meeple as "Carcassonne style", then that's another story. I prefer the workers to be wooden pieces, matching all the structures in color and style.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Re-reading the OP's post and looking through his collection, I'm thinking that he prefers not to have meeples of any sort. I had the same initial impression when I first started playing Euro's - that all meeples looked bland and boring, regardless. But they really do grow on you the more you play with them. At this point, I can't imagine playing something like Viticulture with anything but meeples.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Essentially. I'm still new to gaming but I like little projects. I thought it would be cool to have farmer miniatures instead of meeples. I don't hate meeples, but personally would enjoy more having a little plastic or metal farmer than a meeple.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cool maybe, but my guess is that it would soon become a nuisance. The meeples can be handled much easier than miniatures.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh, I dig those railroad miniatures! I could even imagine that road workers are farmers, though I'd like to see those sculpts more closely. Perhaps even more interesting is that customers who viewed this item also viewed this striking alternative:

I always sell my 7 field early on for quick cash!

I played my first game recently, and sold the 5. I never sold it back, as the other two fields easily provided all I needed to win.

Of course, it was our first game, and I also got the contract cards I needed in an extremely useful order. It was something of a blow-out win. I think the extra 5 lira early helped, but nowhere as much as getting the right contracts at the right time.

There are 40 new visitor cards (40 more than before). "Moor" is a play on words and a nod to Rosenberg's "Farmers of the Moor" expansion to Agricola, as he is one of the designers of this expansion too.

Judging from the picture shown in a different thread, it's all totally new Visitors.

Edit: here's the picture:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric: Indeed, while the original intention was to stay true to the "complete" part of the "complete collector's edition," I couldn't resist designing an expansion with my game design idol, Uwe Rosenberg. These are 40 brand-new visitor cards, as well as reprints of the second-edition Promoter and Tuscany Harvest Machine cards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I can appreciate the lure of working with a personal hero. When you get right down to it, I'm not complaining about having Moor Visitors to choose from.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is there any swapping out of old visitors other than the replacements or do they all just get added to the decks?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There's no swapping--you just shuffle them in to any version of Viticulture and start playing.

Super! It might be a hit at the game cafe where I work. We sell SO MANY COPIES. I taught it to a group of 5 and 6 last night and they all thought it was awesome.

That's great to hear, John! Thank you for teaching the game (and selling it).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We need more people like you, thanks .

Correction: We need moor people like you, thanks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that's my kind of joke, thanks .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, the Promoter and the Harvest Machine will replace the cards from the CCE?

Also, at one point you said you regretted that there was not one visitor that was a person of color. Were you able to correct that? Some of the cards in the picture are a "maybe" on that score.

One more thing: will there be an easy to distinguish these visitors from the New Visitors in Tuscany?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Eric: That's correct about the Promoter and Harvest Machine.

Indeed, I do regret the lack of diversity (at least in terms of race--there's plenty of other types of diversity) among the visitors. However, for the Moor Visitors expansion, I invited Uwe to send me photos of his friends and family to use as the visitors. I thought he might send me at most 10, but he has a lot of friends! So they ended up covering almost every visitor card.

As I've noted, I haven't even actually announced this expansion yet, so I'd prefer to answer questions after that. But yes, it will be easy to distinguish these visitors because there's a small icon on them to identify them as part of this expansion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We need to introduce Uwe to more diverse people!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are the contents merely new visitor cards (and one structure) or are there any other goodies in this expansion. The box looks too large for 40 cards on their own.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's a small box. It contains 40 new visitor cards and 2 reprint cards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ahem 22nd ahem. It's like 3pm here in Myanmar!

It's 1am here on the west coast of the US, so that means it's been the 22nd for at least 3 hours in St Louis! We need our fix!

I jumped on the Viticulture boat a little late and it seems that the Metal Lira Coins are a bit of a rare commodity nowadays. They're no longer on the Stonemaier Games web store and only the silver coins are available from Meeplesource.

Does anyone have any ideas on where I could track down a set, or maybe someone here wants to sell theirs?

I've also been checking eBay, but I haven't had any luck there, either.

Thanks!

FWIW, I'm located in St. Louis, if anyone has a set they'd like to part with.

Kevin: I see that you've filled out our out-of-print request form, which is perfect (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1NQpRkdx6KPDlGy0tjE40X0kTJOF...)

We store our games at Greater Than Games' facility in St. Louis (we're also in St. Louis, and while going through inventory recently, they discovered that we have 5 sets of coins that we didn't know they had. We were going to pick them up this week to sell, but if you're in St. Louis, you could avoid the whole hassle of shipping and just pick them up from Greater Than Games.

Perhaps a dumb question, but once you've harvested from your apple tree and put it in the warehouse, what good is it? Tomato sauce and olive oil give you points, but not apples. Just not sure how to best use the apple tree.

Any help here?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Apples can only be used for increasing morale.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I missed this the first several times I went through the rulebook. If you read the Gameplay section on Morale carefully, you'll see that you can discard grapes, wine, and arbor products at the end of each year to raise worker morale and (ideally) gain that +1 point bonus.

Hilo ID 1525695:
The card reads "As you play this card, put the top card of two different discard piles into your hand." The question is, how does this interact with the winter visitor discard pile?

Does this allow you to take the card showing on top of the winter visitor discard pile before it is covered by Inkeeper?

Do you put the Inkeeper card on top of the winter visitor discard, then take your cards, which would allow you to pick the Inkeeper up again?

Does this card exclude picking up from the winter visitor discard pile altogether?

I tried searching for the answer, but to no avail. We're just not sure how to play this card. I suspect number 1 is correct, but we ended up playing by number 3.

I've always played with option 1, but I'm by no means an official source.

Can you imagine a more relaxing life than wine making? Sitting out on your veranda on a warm summer’s evening, looking out over your sweeping lines of carefully tended vines, grapes even now growing more plump and juicy. Soon it will be time to harvest them, crush them and set the pre-wine juices aside to mature into wine. Fine wines, like the one you’re sipping right now. Breathe that fresh, clean air.

When you first lay out the boards for Viticulture you’ll be transported to your very own veranda. The tranquil, subdued artwork giving a birds eye view over the local village, as if seen from the Tuscan hills. Your own player board, a farm filled with possibilities. Virgin fields waiting vines and the foundations for new, better buildings to make your vineyard the envy of your neighbours. It’s not compulsory to be sipping from a large glass of good wine when playing Viticulture, but it is strongly advised.

From your veranda, you will be ordering your workers down to the village to build up your reputation as the best vineyard in the region. This, naturally, involves growing and harvesting grapes, turning them into wine and fulfilling contracts to sell that wine to buyers, near and far. But you’ll also want to attract visitors to your vineyard, train new workers and build structures on your vineyard that allow you to do more stuff, or to gain various bonuses. Owning a vineyard isn’t a holiday, especially not when everyone else will be trying to get in your way.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
is, in classic Euro-game style, a worker placement game, which means it’s tight and it’s tense. Each action has only a limited number of spaces available that, once filled with your colourful wooden workers, prevent other players from taking that action. You are forced to prioritise where you visit each turn. The other limitation is the tragically small group of workers you have available, meaning that each in-game year you can only visit a small subset of locations. Of course, you actually want to do everything, immediately.

Worker placement games are two-a-penny in the board game industry now a days but Viticulture mixes up that gameplay in a couple of interesting ways. Firstly, it features multiple spaces for each action, which scales with the number of players in a simple and elegant way. In a 2-player game only one of the three are available, 3-4 players have two spots to fight over, while in a 5-6 player game all three spots are available. This allows the game to feel similarly tight and interesting at all player counts (for the most part). The second tweak is the addition of bonus spots at each location; these reward the first player to take that action, maybe making that building a little bit cheaper or letting you take two cards from a deck instead of one. It’s a nice addition that makes the first decisions in a turn that little bit harder: do you take the less important action for the bonus, or the essential action now while there is still space? It encourages you to think through what your opponents are likely to be doing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To take some of the pressure off, however, there are the grande meeples. Big burly wooden workers that you wouldn’t want to get into a bar fight with. They let you take an action even if all the spaces are filled, ensuring that one action you desperately need to perform is available to you once per round. However, there is always a multitude of things you need to do and even with this lovable giant, the game is going to get frustratingly tight.

This would normally be a good thing but has an unexpected consequence. Viticulture re-implements the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“get your workers out of bed” mechanism for determining turn order. It’s a good mechanism; the later you get up the better the bonus reward you get, but the later in turn order you go. Unfortunately the shear importance of hitting your key action spots means that most of the time you’ll be launching your workers out of bed at the earliest opportunity, effectively removing much of that phase’s decision making.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The final and most important change to the worker-placement formula is how the action spaces are split into seasons, specifically summer and winter. The summer spaces are focussed on planting new vines, building new constructions and giving tours of your vineyard for cash. Winter is harvest time, crushing your grapes to make wine, and selling wine to complete contracts, which is your main source of victory points. Each year you are forced to decide how much to commit to each season, because a worker used in the summer cannot be used again in the winter. These lazy workers need a whole year to recover!

In the early rounds of the game, the summer spots are in high demand as everyone tries to get their vineyards into functional shape, while in the late game everyone is battling to produce wine and complete contracts so the winter spaces become the focus. The game balances on a fine edge between these two different halves and deciding when to tip over from summer into winter is the most important decision of the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is also tied to the resources you need to manage. In the early rounds you’ll be desperately fighting over money in order to train new workers and build stuff in your vineyard (those cellars don’t come cheap you know!), but in the later rounds money is no longer an issue and wine is the most important commodity. Get to the final phases with a surplus and you’ll be laughing (not just because you can drink that surplus), but it is all too easy to get trapped in a cycle of selling the wine you produced that year, an unsustainable practice when those spots get tightly fought over. Fine tuning this engine is the core of the game and is hugely rewarding when you get it right.

Fortunately, selling wine is not the only way of improving your reputation. While you are unlikely to win without at least fulfilling one delivery, clever use of the suspicious looking visitor cards you can collect, using the reputation garnering bonus spaces or throwing up a windmill or a tasting room to earn reputation points each turn can be very effective ways of gaining a lead while avoiding the late game scrum down on the docks or at the crush pad.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frustratingly though, the clever use of visitor cards can sometimes come down to good draws. On the one hand I love that you never know how useful a visitor is going to be until they turn up, it’s thematic. But on the other, drawing a visitor who’s only going to provide cash at the end of the game leaves players feeling cheated. Likewise, contract cards can be fantastically useful or a hopeless waste depending on what vine cards you drew earlier in the game. It is quite plausible for a player to not draw any grapes of a particular colour if they are unlucky. I personally feel the game tests your ability to adapt and forces you to expend effort in collecting as many cards as you can to mitigate the bad draws, but it’s going to be an issue for some players.

I really love Viticulture. It may have some rough edges but it is a joy to play whenever I get it to the table. The theme is magnificently captured by the mechanics of the game, and it imbues an evening with a pleasant relaxed feeling, with the welcome exception of the last mad dash to garner reputation. It’s a great introduction to the world of worker placement games, so long as you watch out for the convoluted, bead-juggling, winemaking rules. Games that require players to jump through multiple hoops to earn victory points are often characteristic of heavier, more challenging, games, yet here the strong thematic elements really help new players to understand what they need to do. An exceptional achievement, and to top it all off the production quality of this game is second to none!

Thanks for this review.

About this:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YES, it can be very frustrating. My wife and I played a game today where she kept drawing red grape cards and white wine contracts. She drew and drew, wasting worker actions, and kept striking out. Whereas I received a more helpful selection of cards. The final score was 26-15. You can sort of mitigate this by building the cottage and increasing your visitor card draws, but you are still at the mercy of luck and if you can't draw the right cards, the luckier players will race ahead.

We still like the game, but find it frustrating some times, like today.

I'd add that I think the solo game is quite good. I play Viticulture solo often.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Urgh that sounds like a disastrous session! Am I right in saying that Tuscany goes some way to fixing these issues? Sadly I don't have a copy yet. Likewise that means I haven't had chance to play it solo either but I'm glad to hear it's good, I'll look up the rules and give it a try at some point!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mind you, we're playing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
, which has some of the expansions from Tuscany, but I forget which it has and which it doesn't. I do like this game enough, despite the luck factor, that I would consider buying Tuscany, or whatever "Essential Tuscany" expansion they publish in the future to compliment Essentials.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I haven't mastered the game by any means, but a few times I've had the feeling that one could do well (win, I don't know) using cards to get points. Some cards give you points for discarding wines from your cellar, and other cards give you points if your opponents do x. Might be hard to get to 20 points only doing this, but one of these days, I'm going to try it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ah! Ok then, obviously not. As futhee says below, there are alternate ways of scoring points but they still rely on drawing the right (in this case Visitor) cards. Still, it's good that you enjoy it enough to eye up the expansion!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You might need the windmill/tasting room as well but that would be really fun to try!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good point. And you know what? I never buy those buildings. They feel like such luxuries to me, but I'll have to give it a go.

If you use the + 1 space,can you make 3 wine tokens?

Since it says up to, you can use the space without taking an action, correct?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You have to make at least 1 wine token (otherwise you're not using the action, which isn't allowed). But yes, with the +1 space, you can make up to 3 wine tokens.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have an arcane question on top of that: Back when we used the Friendly Rule (no stealing of bonus actions), we always read the "up to" literally, ie. it was allowed to take the +1 bonus spot and still make only one wine. Is our reading correct?

I performed a quick search of the forums, but didn't see if this question has been asked and answered. I feel certain it must have been, though, so my search skills must be lacking. Apologies for repetition.

Is it possible to buy the 2ed or EE game board on its own? I have a copy of the first edition, and I have a copy of the upgrade pack, and my copy of Tuscany is arriving tomorrow. I haven't read the rules yet, but I'm very excited to try this one out.

It looks like some spots on the 1ed board need to be covered by the replacement tiles provided in the 2ed upgrade pack. It probably won't be a big issue, but I have a feeling that solution will bug me a bit. I'd much rather buy an updated board, if such a thing is available.

Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David: Thanks for your question. We don't have individual boards to sell, but as you mentioned, there are tiles you can use to update the board. Also, once you get to the extended board in Tuscany, you probably won't use any other boards unless you're teaching the game.

The other day I wondered how my gaming group was doing in terms of in-game speed. The same question came up in the forums the other other day. To stop wondering, let's have a survey!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Take note that the Tuscany board has four seasons, which extends play time quite a bit compared to the standard board (which only has 2).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You still have the same number of actions. I'm not sure, I guess you have a bit more options on the board to consider. Will that make the game longer or shorter?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It also depends on the number of players.

That being said, in my last 20 games of 2 player, using the extended board, 3 went 7 years (all 3 times someone was over 20 at the end of the 6th year), 1 went 5 years, and 16 went 6 years. I can't even imagine a game going 8+ years.

Will be trying a new strategy involving the windmill and yoke... planting, harvesting and uprooting had never been explored within our gaming group. And from what I ve read in other threads, not a strategy that has been discussed a lot, yet. So thumbs up and I will let you guys know how it worked out... we re playing 5P.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember that you can only use Windmill once per year
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a point generator, two moves to get one point is inefficient.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mick: That's correct about uprooting, though it is interesting to see how it might fit into someone's strategy. Given that you can only get 1 VP a year from the Windmill, as Eric noted, it's probably not the best use of 2 workers.

Hi all, I have a fair trade offer on the table and am wondering if I should proceed. My wife and I will only every play this 2 player. Is it ok to just own the 1st edition and maybe add a "grande worker". Or should I pass on the trade and purchase essentials. I'm "trying" not to by any new games, instead trade away games that get no love in our household. So, I'd rather just stick with the 1st Ed. if it is a good game on it's own and maybe later add the upgrade pack and Tuscany.

What says the Geek?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Geek in me said "upgrade!!!" So I did it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would not want to play the game without the Grande worker. Having said that, there are easy ways of adding this on a low budget using only a wee bit of creativity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would say pass on the trade and get the Essential edition. Viticulture is a good game but with Tuscany it's a great game it really kicks it up a notch.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've played both and I prefer the upgrades in the essential edition. There are little things on the board and player boards that I miss when I play the first edition with friends.

Also make sure to get a copy of Tuscany.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stonemaier sells upgrade packs from 1st to 2nd edition and an EE upgrade pack, so you could get the 1st edition full game and upgrade that way.

edit: Their shop is here: http://stonemaier-games.myshopify.com/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Get it, get the upgrade kit as soon as possible, get Tuscany if you like the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our first copy of Viticulture was a spare parts 1st edition version (no box) while we were playtesting a PnP of Tuscany. We made our 'Grande' workers by drawing on one meeple per player with a permanent marker - colouring in their hats and drawing on eyes and a moustache...

It was enough to get going with the base game, for sure.

However, I reckon now I would *never* play without Mamas and Papas and Advanced Visitors (i.e. most of what the EE offers).

That being said, Byron did point out the 1st-to-2nd edition upgrade pack (as well as the EE upgrade pack) so you could just get those and save some money by keeping your 1st edition.

Hello Viticulture fans!

When I first played Viticulture a couple weeks ago it was love at first sight! One of my gaming groups became addicted to it immediately. Hell, even my wife liked it!

Everthing perfect, right? Well... not exactly. After 12 games played I only won 1! Damn ONE!

I tried to read some strategy topics on BGG but they are rare. I need your help!

Here's some mistakes I spotted on my stategies so far:

BEFORE: On my first games I tried to train all the workers I could, as fast as I could. I always ended with six workers.
AFTER: I realized that sometimes it took too much money and actions to do it. Now I tend to finish the game with 4-5 workers.

BEFORE: I used to build a Trellis, an Irrigation and sometimes a Windmill before Plant my first vine.
AFTER: I try to Plant as soon as I can, building Trellis and Irrigation or anything else on demand.

BEFORE: I didn't give to much importance to visitors or building a Cottage.
AFTER: I try to build a Cottage and get two card in the fall as soon as I can.

BEFORE: I got the extra worker every chance I got, not giving too much importance to the first actions.
AFTER: I'm always the first to play, since the best bonuses combined are far more powerful than any of the spring bonuses.

BEFORE: I tried to squeeze every point on spring bonus, selling grapes bonus, giving tours with Tasting Room, planting with Windmill etc.
AFTER: I try to fill as many orders as I can, even two orders in one year using Winter Visitor whenever I can.

Now I ask you, guys: What I'm doing wrong?!

My strategies are wrong? My approach is too strategic and I have to think in terms of tactics as in a chess endgame, counting every worker, every year?

Please, help me!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would say you need to adjust your strategy based on the cards you draw - that is where most of the randomness in this game comes in.

Visitor cards are immensely valuable - try and use them to advance yourself as much as possible (and note that the Advanced visitors in Tuscany/Viticulture EE tend to be more balanced, giving bonuses in both early and late game)

The most VP can be gained from wine orders - but you need to have planted grapes to match - so if you've drawn an order card that gives 5VP but requires high pointed white grapes and you've only got red vine cards, you either need to draw more vine cards, or draw new wine orders: the bonuses on the wakeup track can generally help with these (same goes for drawing visitors).

Extra workers are good, yes but I agree that you probably don't need all six - four or five is probably good.

Whether I use the cottage or not will depend on if I have the money to build it and whether I need other structures first - I'd say the medium and large cellars are more important, because they allow you to have larger value wines which allow you fill higher pointed wine orders.

I don't think Viticulture is a game you can use the same strategy every game, you need to change what you do based on your starting position (if using Mamas and Papas) and on what cards you draw. What the other players do does affect it slightly - after all, if they block where you want to go you've only got one grande worker, and waiting another year to take that action can sometimes be very detrimental.

Basically, work out at the start of the year what you want to do in summer and what you want to do in winter, and then possibly make a plan B; and then adjust all those plans based on the card draw and what other players do.

But of course, it's a strategy game, and this is pretty common for all strategy games!

We had a conversation the other day about when you can use the yoke to harvest a field. My brother in law said that you must wait until the winter to use it to harvest as the grapes are growing during the summer. I see his point because you can only harvest with the board action during the winter. Thematically it makes sense. My response was that you should be able to use it in the Summer if you choose.

The rules state that you can harvest in either summer or winter. What are your thoughts on this?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yoke *can* be used to harvest during the summer, so you are correct. It's important to remember, however, that you can only harvest a field once per year. So if you harvest a particular field with your yoke in Summer, you cannot harvest it again using the harvest space in Fall/Winter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can use it anytime.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shhh...Don't tell the Magic the Gathering police, but we 'tap' the field cards to remember this...

Hey guys,

I hope you are well. I'm sorry if this has been asked before, I really tried to find a thread with this info but no success.

If I have got on my crush pad a red grape with a value of 9, can I make red wine for a lower value even if I have medium and large cellar available?

Another example is if I can make a blush wine with value of 8 by combining a 6 white grape and a 4 red grape? Obviously I would be using more grapes than required but I'm just not sure if I can do that.

Thanks for your help!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ibrahim: You can do that if the 9-value blush spot is already taken by another token. In that case, you would make an 8-value blush wine token instead.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey Jamey,

Thanks for taking the time to reply this. So, you can never decide to use a high-value grape to convert it to a lower-value wine? you always have to make wine for the specific grape's value?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why would you want to? It's better to put off devaluing the grapes/wine as long as you can.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris' question/point is a good one. I can't think of any incentive to deliberately devalue your wine.

Remember, you can always overspend when filling a wine order -- so if you need an 8 Blush, either an 8 or 9 Blush token will be acceptable.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm not sure, perhaps I'm just confused as today was my first play ever. So my other question is similar but it's in regards to orders.

If an order requires a red wine with value of 5 and white wine with value of 3 for example, can I cover the order if I have got those wines with higher value? I guess you can as the rulebook says "at least".

Thanks for the help guys.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. You can fill the order with a higher-value wine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ok thanks for the help guys! I'm sorry about the silly questions!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You asked no silly questions, and I assure you everyone was happy to answer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can you make Sparkling wine per the visit card (higher value wine) "even though you don't have the large cellar"? Or do you have to have the large cellar regardless to make sparkling wines?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You always need a big enough cellar to hold the wine value in question.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The card states you can regardless of the cellar.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The card I am referring to is "Zymologist" it states:
Make up to 2(wine) of value 4 or greater, even if you haven't upgraded your cellar.

Basically the rules states you can only make blush wines if you have at least a medium cellar and Sparkling wines if you have the large cellar. Does this card forgo the needing the Large cellar to make a sparkling wine?

The new rules faq state: Thus, if you use this card to make a 5-value red token, you may place it on the 5-value space even if you don't have the medium cellar. However, for the token to age any further you must have the correct cellar size.

So, the situation was this: player had a medium cellar, but NOT a large cellar however, using this card is she able to make a sparkling wine?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, you can use the Zymologist to make a sparkling wine.

Also, there has been a clarification. Your wine will age within the current cellar level, even if the cellar has not been built, but will not age to the next level. So a 5-value wine will age to 6 (or 7 to 8 to 9), but 6 will not age to 7 until you build the large cellar (after having built the medium).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ah, my apologies then. I haven't played with EE cards so I haven't seen that one before. Looks like EricHogue has it right:

So I was procrastinating and looking for the link to the PDF of visitor cards to check something when I decided to read the FAQ. Procrastination is so much fun.

I learned that the Yoke space cannot be used twice, meaning the Grande worker cannot be placed there if it is already full. This is inconsistent with all the other places workers go, and while that is explainable with "special action on the player board" type magic, this collided in my head with another idea.

I've always wondered what playing 1st Edition Viticulture must be like. I often think when playing 2nd Edition that the Grande workers are used so much to prevent being blocked out that it seems to be taking away too much tension. Using a spot twice also seems especially valuable and is used often by most of my opponents, and myself. And that feels really odd compared to other worker placement games.

With young kids in the house I don't get enough plays of Viticulture to experiment with either the original rules or house rules, but it makes me want to ask this: Was the Grande worker every play tested with the additional constraint of not being able to go on a spot where the player already had a normal worker? (e.g. exactly how the yoke spot works)

Opinions on the idea and general speculation on my way of thinking is also welcome here.

Edit: I only play this 2 or 3 player.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eddie: I wouldn't actually say that it's inconsistent. The rule for the grande is that it can be placed on the art of any action on the game board to take that action when the action spaces are full. The private actions on each vineyard mat aren't on the board.

Originally, the grande worker could be placed on the Yoke; it was playtested, and it works fine. However, once the structure expansion was added to Tuscany--many cards of which include private action spaces--we realized that we needed a consistent rule that delineated private action spaces from public action spaces on the board, as some of the structure card private action spaces would be way too strong if you could place a grande next to them to take them twice.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, as my corrected answer in another thread shows--I've been playing with one of your ideas. I had gotten into my head somewhere that you could only play once per year in any spot. This has kept the game pretty tight in that you get one shot to do any particular action even if you had a worker and the spot was still open.

Even with the grande worker, I see the options fill up. We have all quickly developed the habit of jealously guarding that big guy and saving him as long as possible, hopefully just as the final worker of the year.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well if the spots are left open for you, I don't see any reason to not take them.

Maybe it makes a lot more sense once structures hits the table, but in my family setting where we play once or twice a month we will see it sometime in 2017 Without that, it does feel inconsistent - the grande can go into any space that is occupied, except that one. (player board vs game board doesn't really have substance as a concept when there is one space on the player board)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those of us who had the 1st edition KickStarter also had the Aboriculture board, and the Grande was not playable as a second use on that board, either. For example, you could not cask twice in one game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for jogging my memory, Eric! You're right about the grande worker not being able to go next to any private action space.

Yes.

Yes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I believe you can.

Thanks for the quick responses. Can you also tell me how the Automa scores VPs in the solo variant? I don't see that explained in the essential edition other than the campaign rules.

Awesome, three replies within 1 minute . Thank you for helping out.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You not only can, but without the larger cellar, you must make the lower value. Same goes if you already have the resulting value wine in your cellar (e.g., you have a value 3 red, but you already have a 3 red in your cellar--you must devalue to a 2 red).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This has been answered correctly by others, but I'll add that this is perfectly shown on Page 15 of the Essential Edition rulebook, Example 1. See also Note 2 on this page, as well as Note 3 on the same page and Note 2 on page 14.

I can't copy and paste the text from the Stonemaier provided PDFs or I totally would.

Does everyone have to place atleast one worker in the summer?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave's answer sums it up well. On your turn, you have the option to (a) place a worker or (b) pass (which ends your ability to place workers that season). Those rules apply to both summer and winter in Viticulture (there is no worker placement in spring and fall until you unlock the extended board in Tuscany).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A player can place workers in summer only, in winter only, or in both summer and winter. The only stipulation is that once you pass in any given season, you cannot place any more workers that season.

My partner and I tried Viticulture with the expansion board. While I feel that it definitely solved some of the mild issues I had with the base game board (such as the option of waking up first almost seems to be the optimal option for 75% of the game), we were both lukewarm on the area-control aspect of the expansion board as a 2P experience.

On the other hand, we both loved the new structure deck, having 4 different seasons to play actions on, and also the new "waking order" track.

Am I alone in feeling that way?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ethan: I don't think you're alone in your thoughts about 2-player area control, and I'm just as curious as you to hear what others think. My perception is that it isn't broken, but it's also not as good as it could have been. I recently heard the issue discussed on an episode of

https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepodcastepisode/169411/lon...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The one chance I've had to play with it (my gaming buddy and I are still working through the Tuscany tiers), what is usually a tight game for us, turned into a trounce as I used those areas to great effect early in the game.

Can't say it was an issue per se based on one play, but we did both agree he should not have ignored that area the first half of the game.

I'm not sure of the meaning of this card.

It say : Discard 2 cards to draw 1 of each type of card (max of 4)

Does it mean that you can draw à max of 4 cards, or that you may discard max 4 times to draw others cards ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think that if you play the basic viticulture you should forget about the max of 4 you just pick one of each card.

If I remember well the max of 4 was introduced to handle an extension of the game that might introduce another type of cards

I love this game! I have played a few times solo and have a hard time generating enough points to beat the Automa. Any tips or tricks? It seems like I am having a hard time getting my machine running in 7 years .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Which Tuscany modules are you including?

I tried playing the base game with Automa once, and I got nowhere near 20 points by the end of 7 rounds. I think if you start with at least Mamas & Papas, then your starting position is a little better so you have a better chance to beat the Automa's 20 points. If you add in one or two other Tier 1 Tuscany expansions you may also have a better chance, as it gives you a choice of more things to do too...

I'm sure Morten will have better hints, of course

Winter visitor the Motivator: Each player may retrieve their grande worker...

The rules clarify that "opponents that have passed this season are not eligible to retrieve their grande workers".

But in Winter I don't think of myself as having passed, but rather, I'm just out of workers for the moment, so have nothing to do. Now I have an opportunity to replay my grande worker.

The rules also don't use the term "pass" for the winter season. For summer, it says "This cycle continues until all players have passed". But for winter, it says "This cycle continues until all players have played all of their workers."

So, if this Winter visitor is played during Winter and I have skipped my previous turn because I have no workers, can I retrieve my grande worker and replay it? Or do we consider that have indeed passed?

Also, if the Motivator is played during Summer (rare as that might occur) after I have passed, I'd like to retrieve my grande worker to use in Winter. But the clarification in the rules prevents this. Maybe Jamey and Alan didn't think of this?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George: On your turn in Viticulture, you either place a worker OR you pass. So if it's your turn in the winter and you can't place a worker, you must pass out of winter. It's after that point that a Motivator played by an opponent no longer applies to you.

If the Motivator is somehow played in the summer (it's a winter visitor, so it's nearly impossible for that to happen), if you've already played your grande worker that year, of course the Motivator ability applies to you.

2-fold question:
- How do I Essential-ize my visitor decks?
- Should I?

How
I have Viticulture 2nd Ed. and Tuscany. The instructions for Tuscany say to mix in the advanced and new visitors into existing base game decks, but IIRC Viticulture Essential Edition does away with some base game cards to improve the balance of the decks. Can I modify my visitor decks to make them exactly the same as the Essential Ed. visitor decks? If so, which cards do I remove?

Should
Are there any cards not included in the Essential Ed. that one would still want to leave in the game for whatever reason? Perhaps some cards that only make sense if playing with the Tuscany expansion?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Advanced Visitors section has an option rule section that lists all of the duplicate (weaker) original visitors that can (and probably should) be removed. If you don't have the rulebook handy, you can sort the cards to find all the ones that have two versions (regular and advanced) and remove the regular version.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for that! Aside from the obvious duplicates listed in the manual, are there other cards to remove?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm fairly certain Jamey has stated that that is the only card change made for the Essential Edition, but I'll have to find his quote to be sure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's all the information about it, including a file showing all cards in the Essential Edition: http://stonemaiergames.com/games/viticulture/essential-editi...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fantastic! Thanks, Jamey.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, I'm sorry to resurrect an outdated thread, but is there any chance of adding some additional information on the relationship between Tuscany and the Essentials edition to the Essentials page?

Because I play Viticulture so rarely, I was surprised to find out that there was another update to Viticulture and I wasn't sure if I needed to buy anything in order to bring my copy up to date. There's just a small note on the bottom of http://stonemaier-games.myshopify.com/products/update-pack-f... that says that "these components are also included in Tuscany", but there's no information on where those components are or how to use your copy of Tuscany to simulate having the Essential edition. The page for the Essential Edition says that it uses "various visitors" from Tuscany, but I don't know which ones. I guess that's the intended use of the full visitors sheet -- at first I thought I was supposed to compare my visitors with them to see if I had the right edition.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ethan: A full list of Visitors cards from the various editions and expansions is here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mCRAuf99t6tuiPRWHbaf...

"there's no information on where those components are or how to use your copy of Tuscany to simulate having the Essential edition."

If you look at the section of the Viticulture Essentials page on our website (http://stonemaiergames.com/games/viticulture/essential-editi...), it specifies exactly which components in Tuscany are now part of the Viticulture Essential Edition.

You can also subscribe to our monthly e-newsletter so stuff like this doesn't come as a surprise--we talked about it there over 8 months ago: http://stonemaiergames.com/e-newsletter/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Jamey, I actually am on your mailing list but had forgotten about this announcement. Probably I skimmed it, determined that I didn't need to do anything about it, and archived it, or maybe I was distracted by the news about Scythe.

Yes, I saw the full card list and the graphical sheet of visitors. Like I mentioned in my first post, I wasn't sure why they were there or how they were going to help me. Eventually I concluded that I was supposed to compare my visitors with the list of visitors, discover that my visitors were different, and order the Essential Upgrade Pack. I guess your intent is to help people like me figure out what visitors to use, but I don't think this spreadsheet is helpful for that.

I'm not sure exactly what text you're referring to on the Essentials Edition page. The first description of what's in it uses the phrasing "Mama & Papas, Fields (Properties), various Visitor cards, & Automa (solo variant)" [my emphasis]. Additionally, the text "has helped us combine" as well as the fact that a game designer was involved made me think that the changes were more involved than just aggregation. In particular, I was concerned that the Essential Edition used just a subset of those expansions, or merged them in some way.

A bit further down, it says "The hardest change to describe is the assortment of 76 visitor cards. Basically, we’ve removed all visitor cards that aren’t useful at certain times in the game and replaced them with the “advanced” version, then removed the word “advanced” so there’s only one version of each visitor." Maybe this was just confusing to me because I haven't opened the new or advanced visitors packs from Tuscany yet (because spoilers). I can see how, paired with the card list, this might have given me enough information to figure out what cards were involved, but I wouldn't describe it as saying "exactly" which components are included.

I understand from reading other threads that you are probably sick to death of this topic and I sympathize. It isn't my intention to rag on you and I do appreciate your commitment to improving your games and wanting to "take care" of your Kickstarter supporters. Instead I'm trying to document something I found confusing and spent some time trying to understand, in case it can help someone else (or, really, myself after I forget it again). Specifically, I'm suggesting that you add a couple brief notes to the page that you linked:

- Tuscany contains everything (plus a lot more) from the Essential Edition, so if you have Tuscany, you don't need the Upgrade Pack. Instead, play with the Mamas and Papas, Properties, and Visitors expansions.
- The Visitors in the Essential Edition are all the "New Visitor" cards combined with the "Advanced Visitor cards," following the instructions of the Advanced cards in the Tuscany rules to remove many of the original visitor cards. The Promo cards are also included. Edit: also, a few additional cards are in the Arboriculture expansion.

Maybe text like this is bad PR or marketing (sounds like you're telling people not to buy your product?), in which case I would have still loved to find this information behind a link that said "Already have Tuscany? Click here!", or an entry in the FAQ (maybe "Tuscany" could go between "Essential Edition" and "Second Edition").

Thanks!

Like the subject says, I can't seem to find Viticulture on Amazon. Tuscany, the expansion is there. Is there a reason for this? I am aware that I can probably find it else where, and will probably pick it up at my FLGS if they have it. But, with the upcoming holiday/gift buying season, I wanted to add it to my Amazon wishlist, which I direct everyone who wants to get me a gift to look at. I was wondering if anyone knew why it wasn't on Amazon. Is it super hard to come by or something?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 2nd edition is out of print and its replacement, Viticulture Essential Edition, will hit retail stores by the end of next week. Not sure when Amazon will pick it up.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is out of print and is sold out most places.

Take a look for Viticulture Essential Edition which is replacing it (and there are lots of threads on here about what exactly it will contain... basically all of Viticulture plus a bit of Tuscany).

Michael is correct, especially on the point that Viticulture won't appear on Amazon until someone starts to sell it there (whether it's Amazon or another vendor). We won't be selling the game through Amazon.

I was wondering about getting this game for my mom and stepdad, who both love wine, and he is in the wine business. I think they would think this a unique Christmas gift. The only thing that stops me is that the heaviest game they have played is monopoly, but I feel would be willing to play, as they do like games in general. They do wine tours a lot, and I think they would love the theme, as this game drips with theme. This would be their first Euro game...what do you guys think. Also, I was thinking of getting them the essentials edition. I appreciate any input!

Thanks and God Bless!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't think it would be a good fit for people who have only played Monopoly. But I guess it would depend on the individuals.

If they aren't competitive and just enjoy games as more of a social experience then it might be alright, since it does have a well-integrated theme and beautiful art. But to succeed in the game requires a fair amount of forward planning. Also points and money are very hard to come by for the majority of the game until you are able to build up a decent "engine", which could be frustrating for certain people depending on what they are looking for out of a game.

Even non-gamers tend to want to do well when playing a game and until you've played this game a couple times and understand the "arc" of how it plays out, it can feel like you are really struggling for more than half the game. Also, the game tends to be around 2 hours length so that is quite long for non-gamers to want to sit for.

YMMV in other words
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1477650:
Going for lots of little victory points can be a valid strategy. However, while it starts out early, it never speeds up much. If somebody is staying out of the way picking all the 1 VP spots, it's not too hard for other players to get a good wine engine going and then start making lots of points.

On the Tuscany board, the game ends at 25 points, which gives other players more time to catch up to and surpass the slow VP tactic. Additionally, with the addition of the "sell wine for VP", players can sell sparkling wines pretty easily for 4 VP a pop.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How many years did the game last? And did either you or your wife ever take that action space before the other player got it? If he was choosing the 6th spot on the wake-up track, you should have always had the chance to get to that action space before he had the chance to do it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'd politely suggest that the action couldn't be better spent on your own engine, because you lost to that player. With the poor cards you had, I wonder if you shouldn't have beaten him at his own land-flipping game, as the wine order strategy wasn't going to work with your cards.

When life deals you a crappy vineyard, make a gastro-pub. Viticulture, to me, is not a game about making wine, it's a game about fixing up this neglected vineyard you've been given, whatever that entails.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For those that wan to avoid reading strategy threads, please change the title of this thread to something non-revealing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think a better solution would be for you to request that a moderator move it to the Strategy forum (by clicking the red "X" under "Recommend" at the top of the page) if you find it to be a bother.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think the worry was that the title itself appearing in the forums potentially gives away some strategy that since people like to figure out on their own ad they explore a game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think moving the post is better than some vague title that doesn't tell you what the post is about. (Then you have to open it anyway and read it to find out that it's strategy related.) Anyone who doesn't want to see strategy shouldn't be browsing or subscribed to the Strategy forum.

Or is buying Vitucultur and Tuscany the better game?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That is what I would go with. (Edit: I meant getting the EE)
I think EE is cheaper than regular version so go with whichever is cheaper. Getting Tuscany or not is entirely different question.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks and do you recommend Tuscany as well to flesh out EE completely?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There has been so much discussion on this in previous threads... I would read them over as you are going to get more info. I believe even the publisher weighed in.

In summary, to me, if you are going to get the 'regular' edition, get Tuscany as well. If you are a completionist, get both of those.

Extended Edition is a good option but there is some overlap with Tuscany if you end up buying that too. The biggest thing missing from EE is the Tuscany board but it is expected to be released as an expansion later... and the regular board was good enough for Uwe Rosenberg!

Hope that helps. But really, go through the older threads. And whatever you get, enjoy

Hi Jamey, I received my copy of Viticulture EE on Monday, thank you.

Once I get round to playing it, where would you like me to assign my (probably high) rating? Here or under the Essential Edition's listing? I suppose I could rate it twice....?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joe: I must admit I don't know what I can say here--I never know when I'm going to violate some sort of BGG rule. So I'll just say that I think most people who look for Viticulture's rating are going to look at the main Viticulture page.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'd say both, BGG needs to change how they group games that are associated, their needs to be a logic that accounts for this (big boxes/el grande/ through the ages are going to have the same issue). Pandemic/Pandemic legacy.. etc.

Maybe the new BGG will have a fix for this?

So in the meantime, I'd say rate Viticulture based upon your experiences that are altered by the EE version, then rate EE as well.

Ideally BGG, would Associate EE/CE of viticulture as being the Base Viticulture and then increase the Ratings of the base, and their'd obviously need to be some way to understand how these are related/not related.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, I don't think this will be addressed in the currently planned update. Most of the update is going to be adjusting outside appearance and accessibility of current content and features.

In looking forward to BGG appearing nicely on mobile though!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I agree. I think the key here is that the only version of Viticulture we're selling from now on is Viticulture Essential--it IS Viticulture. I think it would be different if we were simultaneously selling two different versions of a similar game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
i think the cosmic encounter versions would be somewhat comparable, in that the FF version included a number of expansions. really hope to play that this christmas.

Not sure if this counts as a real variant but all to often me or my friends have been blocked out of a critical action without having our Grande's available. Usually when we have plenty of spare workers too. So we've often joked that we wish we could use two workers like a grande.

It probably doesn't work out and ruins the balance, but might be worth trying out sometime to see how it changes the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That sounds kinda interesting, but it kinda defeats one of the major points of worker-placement games- blocking other players from taking a spot.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Being shut out is part of the game. The Grande is an override capability to balance that out. But you're looking for even more override ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This makes me wonder if you are playing somehow differently than what I expect. What number of players ?

Why would you have already used the Grande so soon? Or why/how are you so richly acquiring spare workers?

I am very interested in the game but, despite research, can't really tell what I should be buying!

I tend to lean toward being a completionist, so I don't know if I should be looking at buying 2nd and Tuscany (if they are even compatible) OR if I should just grab the Essential Edition...

What do you kind people think?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuscany adds a lot to the game. I believe there aren't enough cards in the base game, and the Tuscany expansion makes it great!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2nd edition and Tuscany are compatible and probably what you want to get if you are leaning towards being a completionist. Essential takes 2nd edition and "the best" of Tuscany as a new standalone edition, if I understand correctly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Definitely go for Tuscany. You need the new board and at least the L1 expansions, which makes the game much better.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, except the board. The Tuscany board is much better than the standard one (which I understand comes with the essential edition).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm fairly sure they are going to do a "Tuscany" for the Essential edition so you can get the full Viticulture by whatever route. It might not be a bad way to experience the game without going all in from the start.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They're coming out with a new version for Tuscany as well, which won't include a couple of the expansions from the original Tuscany. If you're a completionist, you might want to pick up the current version of Tuscany... but honestly, you're not losing anything with the stuff they're cutting out.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamey said that's if the current Tuscany sells out and if there's demand for it. If everyone waits for the new one, it'll never come lol

I want people to buy the current Tuscany so that I can get the new Tuscany for my new Viticulture Essential Edition
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are a completionist (like I am), get Tuscany now and the 2d Edition Viticulture, or wait and get the Essential Edition instead of 2nd Edition, which provides a small bit of overlap but may help ease your transition into full-blown Tuscany (the card set in Essential is specially-modified from Tuscany, I understand it to be sort of a "greatest hits" set).

You do not need both the 2nd Edition Viticulture and the Essential Edition.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I had this exact same problem a couple of weeks ago. After a lot of research, I came to a few conclusions:

1) The essential edition will be cheaper, but will lack two expansions that added a lot to gameplay: the exteneded board and structures. If you're a DiceTower fan, it's worth nothing that Tom Vassel and Zee Garcia concluded that these were the two best parts of Tuscany.

2) There are no solid plans for what has been called "Tuscany Lite", which would theoretically include Structures and the extended board. Uwe Rosenburg thought it added too much complexity for new players, so the original board is here to stay. Jamey has commented that it's a possibility... for 2016/2017 only if Tuscany sells out and there's a real demand for it. Unless the essentials edition draws a whole new crowd to Viticulture, I'm not sure I see that happening.

3) If you're a completionist, you'll want to know that Tuscany includes four expansions that Jamey has no intention of re-printing, even if a "Tuscany Lite" comes out.

With all of the good stuff I heard about this game, I also didn't want to wait to play. This left me no choice but to buy Viticulture 2nd and Tuscany now. You may have some trouble finding Viticulture 2nd though, as I bought the last reasonably priced copy I could find from Cardhaus.

It might help to check Boardgame Prices
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Could you (or somebody) elaborate on this a bit? I'm just putting my toes into the desire to purchase this, and am unsure which version to grab as well.

Are they changing any of the core game's rules or components?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The rules of Tuscany aren't changing, nor have the components changed. IF we print a lighter version of Tuscany in the future, it will only contain 3 expansions, not the 12 expansions it currently contains.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But some of those expansions are being brought into the Essentials version of Viticulture, right?

The stuff they're going to leave out are the bits that I don't really love. All the really cool stuff will be in Viticulture Essentials and the lighter Tuscany.

If you want to be completionist, grab Tuscany now. But there are definitely some expansions in Tuscany that are great, some that are okay, and some I don't need to play again. I think all the things that were being left out all fall in the area that I don't need to play again.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So tuscany + 2nd edition vit + the metal coins = everything that exists for the game? (Excluding the big wood box)

The big box is cardboard, but otherwise, yes.

I don't understand why this card exists… It isn't in the spirit of the game and punishes a random player.
Am I the only one?

Edit: I've replaced it with the 'normal' Queen.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I agree. I removed it from my deck.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, first time that came up it generated the first "WTF!" reaction in the game. It's not really (and I don't think it should be) a game of direct player interaction.

I've been following the Dice Tower Top 100 Series and so far I've seen Viticulture appear twice!

Tom Vasel's Personal Top 100 List - #17

While I haven't played Viticulture yet (I ordered the Essential Edition which should be arriving around November I think), seeing it so high on these lists makes me excited to play it!

Congratulations!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very cool. I should be getting my Essential Edition next month, can't wait

Quick clarification requested. There seem to be 3 types of visitor cards related to structures and I would like clarification on whether payment is needed in the third scenario.

1) Pay victory point(s) to build a structure - in this case you are paying vp in lieu of lira

2) Build a structure at x lira discount - in this case you are paying the cost minus the discount from the card. Cost could be as little as 0.

3) Build a structure (i.e. choose 2 of 3 actions, one of which is to build a structure) - in this case I understand that you would still pay the regular cost of the structure to build it. Hubby tells me I'm wrong.

So do structures in scenario 3 still have the regular cost or no?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes you still pay, the card just lets you take 2 of 3 listed actions, all associated costs are still paid for those actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heather: Thanks for these questions!

1. That's correct, pay VP and no lira.

2. That's correct.

3. That's also correct--you must pay the normal cost for the structure in this case. I tried to make sure the words "at its regular cost" is on those cards, but even if those words aren't there, you still have to pay its regular cost.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Awesome - thanks for the replies. Plus I was right - bonus.

As per topic.

I know there was the Tuscany KS in 2014 but the retail copies are extremely low and are priced ridiculously.

Any chance of a reprint / another KS in 2016?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are you referring to Viticulture or Tuscany? Viticulture is getting a new edition called the Essential Edition that will include a few of the modules from Tuscany in the base game like the Mamas & Papas, the Properties, Automa (solo variant). In addition it will have at least the Advanced Visitor cards, not sure if the new visitor cards are included or not.

If you are referring to the Tuscany expansion then no, this will not be reprinted in the same form it appears today. As stated above some of the modules will be incorporated into the new edition of the base game as for the others some will never be made again (like the Mafia module)and the others will likely get put into a new expansion for the new edition of the base game (like the extended board and structures).



TL/DR: Viticulture is being reprinted as a new edition with some of the Tuscany expansion. The Tuscany expansion will not be reprinted, however some of the modules will likely be made as a new expansion to the new edition of the base game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exactly what I needed to know

Thanks, guys!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Dan. I can add that it should hopefully be published before the end of 2015.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's correct--retailers should have Viticulture Essential Edition by December.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is there anywhere we can pre-order this?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can try at Miniature Market--they always carry our games.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hah - That's the first place I looked, they don't have it listed yet. Maybe I'll email them

Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John,
Are you by any chance expecting the first print run of VEE to sell out quickly?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think this question might be for me? I do think VEE is going to sell quickly to distributors, but there should be plenty of copies available for people. Perhaps I underestimated holiday demand--we'll see!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just an update, I asked MM but they didn't have any info on it.

Really don't want to miss out on this game again, so it would be great if someone offered a pre-order for it (that also didn't charge a ridiculous amount for shipping)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Funagain pre-ordered some copies: https://www.funagain.com/control/product?product_id=034500

Hi All,

Played my 1st 2 games yesterday and thoroughly enjoyed the game. Just had a couple of doubts and a hypothetical question.

1. We were playing a 4P game and in one of the winter seasons a player had already placed his worker on the Play Winter Visitor spot with the bonus to play another card, the 2nd spot available was placed by another player who placed his grande Worker (as he ran out of his regular worker)- So he can't get the bonus, but can play it normally. He placed this worker on the left most spot. Now a 3rd player also wanted to play the same action, but she did not have her Grande Worker, but her argument was that Grande Workers don't go the the regular spots so the left most spot would still be available. We were confused though we did not allow her to complete that action as we could not find a specific reference to this rule. Please help.

2. In a 2P game (hypothetical) there is only 1 spot available, so which spot do we use? The one with the Bonus or the left most?

3. How game changing is the luck in this game (drawing cards), though haven't experienced it, have you experienced it that with draw of good cards the player has a distinctive advantage to others? As in can draw of cards offset a beautiful game like this to just being a luck driven game? (As I said in the 2 plays, we didn't experience it, but would be nice to get your thoughts on the same)

Thanks a lot for the help.

Best,
Madhu
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the games I've played, the "luck" of the cards is evened-out pretty fast. Sure, there are some awesome cards (that come up at the right moment), but I don't think I've found the cards to be too swingy, as every player will get good ones and great ones through the course of a few games.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That was a very helpful thread to read! Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since this thread is in the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
forum then you would still be using the standard visitors of the base game for your question about the luck factor. There was a 1st edition of the visitors but they should have been updated for your version. The
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
has 2 sets of visitors to help smooth out the luck factor.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think that you've proven the OP's point. If it takes "a few games" to even out the luck element in card draws, then that is indeed aa game that is highly dependent on the luck of the draw. I'm a big fan of Viticulture, but for me the one downside is how hard it is to win without good cards. I regularly see games won by somebody who gets better card draw than everyone else. This effect is somewhat mitigated by using all the card expansions from Tuscany and playing on the expanded board (where you can at least turn crap cards into something useful as well as drawing more cards without taking an action to do so)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1432610:
So I just picked up Viticulture and Tuscany and am wondering how best to learn the game and introduce others to the game, as some people have noted that they would not play without some of the modules. Ideally, I wouldn't want to ramp up the weight too much from the original Viticulture, at least at the start. Although with that said if I'm learning it from scratch, it may just be easier to learn it at a more difficult level immediately then to unlearn some things later on, so to speak.

So, I noted that the recently announced Viticulture Essential Edition includes Mama's and Papa's, Properties, and New and Advanced Visitors. Is the inclusion with the Essential Edition an indication that they should/could be implemented in pretty much every play immediately without changing the game too much?

What about the new board? I see some people say that they would never play without it. Should I learn and teach the game to new people using the original board or does it just make sense to use the new board if I'll be moving that way eventually?

Finally, does this change if a majority of the plays will be two players?

Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I loved learning on the basic board, so that once that became a little "samey" after a while, it was nice to add the new modules in, including the new board. Feel free to add in the M&P, Properties, and the new/advanced visitors from the beginning, though. I would hold off on the new board, though. It is fine either way with 2P.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We jumped right in with the new board, advanced and new visitors, mamas & papas, and property. None of those things adds much complexity to the game. Possible exception is the new board. We've since added structures which add a little more complexity but very little given how much depth they add.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Personally I'd advise putting in the advanced visitor cards straight away, because they feel like a fix to the base game rather than an expansion per se - and they really reduce frustration, which is the last thing you want new players to experience - but nothing else for a first game. Mamas and Papas should wait at least a little bit until people have a bit more understanding of the values of the various buildings, frequencies of various vines and wines in orders etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have to 2nd putting in the advanced visitor cards (and removing the cards they replace), right away. That fixes a lot of the "draw a useless card issues".

I think if you learned on the expansion board (you can play the side with less expansions on it), it would not be any harder to play than learning the base game.

The only thing I think you have to add to play on the advanced board is the star you put in the different areas of the map to get items right away and fight for victory points later. (you can just ignore the flip field spot).

Now with that said, I think the mama, and papa expansion really accelerates the start of the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tagging along with this post, would anyone recommend getting just the Essential edition, or stick with Viticulture with Tuscany?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The big things missing with the essential edition is the new board and structures. Those two make a big difference in the game the other stuff is nice but quite necessary. So if you really want those two things then you can buy Viti/Tuscany or buy the essential and wait for them to make a new expansion with some of the stuff they left out.

Or we could get a game day in and I could bring my copy for you to try out
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I had to look up what was in the Essential edition...

Mamas & Papas expansion from Tuscany: 36 Mamas & Papas cards
Property expansion from Tuscany: Field cards
Solo variant from Tuscany: 24 Automa cards
Selected mix of cards from Viticulture & Tuscany: 76 Visitor cards


So while I do enjoy the Mama and papa expansion, and the property expansion , that is just two of the 5 or 6 expansions I normally play with. It also sounds like the board is the base Viticulture board and not the advanced Tuscany board.

So if you just want to play a few times and not add too much customization to the game, the essential edition looks like it would work (and hopefully be cheaper).

The solo variant is not really that important to me and you get visitor cards either way, so that is a wash.

What would put me into wanting Tuscany and Viticulture Instead is the Tuscany board with built in expansions, along with the special workers (I really like the special workers as they make you have to think outside the box a bit more, and make the game easier to replay).

If you have all of the expansions you can play them all and then pick and choice the best of the best for your normal games (which is what I do). I also really like the Tuscany playing board and how they change up the seasons.

This is just my thoughts , But so far everyone I have shown the new Tuscany board to said it really made the game more interesting.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you've already got Viticulture and Tuscany, the essential edition doesn't add anything I don't think, apart from a couple of very minor errata which are easy to include.

For me, a friend has both, I'm just going to pick up the essential edition for myself, I can play the other expansions with said friend.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most people have good advice here

In my case, even when teaching this to new players, I will at an absolute minimum throw in Mamas and Papas and the Advanced Visitors (replacing their corresponding original visitors). Both of these don't change the rules by anything significant, give players a better starting position with a little asymmetry (M&Ps) and fix some balance issues with the original base game (AVs).

Other than this, throwing in New Visitors doesn't hurt either.

Properties (the ability to sell fields) is only a minor step up, so include if you think you want to, but I wouldn't consider it essential for a first game, especially teaching new folk.

So basically, everything in the Essential Edition is definitely great, and good for learning the game.

Although we playtested Tuscany and have got the lovely full set, we've still not quite got to the point of introducing any more modules than the ones I've mentioned above! One day we'll get to the extended board, I'm sure.

I have the first edition rules which I recognize have been changed somewhat with the newer second edition. My question relates to the Making Wine (formerly known as Crush Grapes) action, specifically whether or not you can combine two grapes of the same type to make a higher value red or white wine.

The first edition rules (p. 10) make it fairly clear that the answer to this question is no when it states that: "Multiple grapes of the same color are not combined to make a higher-value wine ..."

This same language does not appear in the second edition rules, or in the three-page update on the company website, but it is kind of implied that red and white wines are both done on a one-for-one basis, and that combining is only allowed for the blush and sparkling wines. On the other hand, there is some language to the effect that: "There are no restrictions to the type of wine you can make," that seems to open the door for a less restrictive interpretation.

So, to make it clear, is this restriction (against combining grapes of the same time to make higher-valued red or white wines) carried forward from the first to second edition rules?

Have you looked into the possibility of doing a large-print version of the visitor cards? Many of us of a certain age (and one of my compatriots is married to a person another decade older), are used to having reading glasses, but it would be nice to be able to play without them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've thought about it, but the issue is that there's limited space on the board and on the vineyard mats.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, you could always drop the art for the visitor cards. It's really nice, but does take up quite a bit of space. And if large print were to look weird on small cards because too few letters fit in one line, you could always make the visitor cards landscape- rather than portrait-orientated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think people who need the large print cards would be OK putting them on the table. I can think of many other reason you might not want to do it, however. I was just wondering if you had looked into it.

Hi everyone,

I'm a happy owner of the original KS edition of Viticulture, and have been considering adding something to it in one way or another - but there are so many options! 1st ed upgrade, Tuscany, Essential Edition, metal coins... And it all looks so good!

To keep it short: what would you recommend?

Or even shorter: help!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to have the option of playing a heavier variant of Viticulture that has loads of modular expansions that increase variety while still playing Viticulture, then buy Tuscany

If you want to slightly extend your existing Viticulture to a sort of "2.0" release - i.e. add the expansions that "everyone" "always" plays with, then buy the newly announced Essential Edition Conversion pack

Buy the coins. Just do it. Buy several packs, you'll use them in all your games. (I have three packs, one in the Collector's Edition box, and two in my flight case of gaming bits that always travels to sessions)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whichever comes with the new board with all four seasons.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's Tuscany. But that takes the game from a good mid-range WP game to a somewhat more advanced game. Hence the guidance I gave above.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you both for your recommendations!

Just to be sure (and given that I already own the first edition Viticulture):
a) Are the changes from 1st to 2nd edition Viticulture included in Tuscany?
b) Does Tuscany include everything in the Essential Edition (plus some more)?

I kind of feel that if I didn't already own the original, I would probably go for the Essential Edition. But since I do, it seems like Tuscany adds more value. Unless I have missed something, which has been known to happen.

Either way, I will probably not be able to resist the coins
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrik: Thanks for your questions! My answers are below:

a. No, they're not. For that you'll need the 1st edition upgrade pack (http://www.amazon.de/Stonemaier-Games-Viticulture-Update-Pac...).

b. Yes, it does.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you Jamey for your answers - although I can't say it made my decision any easier! Still, to be able to tell my wife that the designer is actively involved in the forums will probably make the purchase an easier sell for me at home

Keep up the good work and best of luck with your current projects!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is the story on what happened next:

I couldn't make up my mind, but then I stumbled upon a copy of Tuscany Prima including metal coins and the Viticulture 1st ed upgrade pack...

Ok so it's a short story

Hi All,

I came across this game in a game store near my house, and really liked the idea reading the back cover, so saw some reviews as well and thought the game was really interesting. But just to get an idea how heavy is this game compared to the ones I'm familiar with.

I play Powergrid, Puerto Rico, Princes of Florence, Thurn & Taxis, Macao, Troyes, Caylus, Steam, Brass, Russian Railroads, Poseidon, Agricola, Notre Dame etc. I know Viticulture is completely different to these games, but wanted to know in terms of heaviness is it comparable to any of these, just for me to get a vague idea and pitch it to my group.

I own Vinhos, but haven't played it as whenever I've tried to explain the rules to people, they felt it was too heavy for them. So don't want this one to end up like that. I really really want to play Vinhos because of the wine theme game, but can't play.

I was wondering if this game is slightly easier on players to learn and play and is not too much of a brain burn.

Your thoughts will help me decide.

Thanks,
Madhu
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think it's more on the level of Thurn and Taxis (maybe a little more than that), somewhere around Stone Age, but not Agricola or Vinhos.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is not heavy no, fits right in with what you have played. The race element makes it feel a little different than most worker placements though.

However, add in the Tuscany expansion and this changes dramatically to a heavy mid weight. Enough decisions come out to out it up there with Vinhos, but now as hard to grok.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is a medium weight game, similar to or a little heavier than Agricola or Stone Age and perfect for family or friends that don't like them too heavy. The game gives enough options for experience player to challenge themselves and find different (more challenging) routes to victory (especially with the Tuscany expansion). Brass or Vinhos are a different league...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think it is significantly lighter than Stone Age and Agricola. But still a medium weight game. Its quite a lovely design to introduce people to worker placement games with.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In my opinion it's roughly between Stone Age and Agricola. Here's the order that I'd put them.

I added Tuscany (which I highly recommend as a future purchase), as well as Ticket to Ride (just to have as a baseline). I also added the BGG weights which are a great tool. The BGG weights are the numbers in the parenthesis and can be found in the stats section on a game page. They typically include hundreds of user opinions, sometimes thousands.

https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128621/viticulture#s...

From Gateway to heavier medium:

1. Ticket to Ride (1.9) - Gateway game
2. Stone Age (2.5) - Next step game (light weight)
3. Viticulture (2.9) - Medium/Light
4. Tuscany (3.3) - Medium/Medium
5. Agricola (3.6) - Medium/Heavy

It's a fantastic game and definitely not heavier than the games you have been playing.

I do have to say that it isn't a super fast teach but that it makes thematic sense. No wonky rules or scoring, just a bit of time to explain it all. Less than Agricola both on teaching and brain burn.

Great flow and fantastic game. One of the best expansions to a game as well. Modular and simple to add expansions as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At least as far as the base game goes I'd say lighter weight than Agricola.

Solidly in the medium weight category.

There's more going on than in Power Grid in that there are more options and strategies (from my limited exposure to Power Grid).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can somewhat connect with this. The individual rules are simple but with very few workers and when the efficiency of objectives requires concentrating on the order of precedence for some tasks then I find that I must work much harder at this game than I do for the previously mentioned Stone Age.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks so much guys, looks like it is right up my ally and my group won't find it daunting as well!

VITICULTURE it is....Tuscany....quickly following!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No more than 2 lbs at most.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With the metal coins it maybe more
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's why the metal coins are only recommended for gamers who prefer heavier, more strategic games.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frankly I'm shocked it took that long for that joke to show up.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ah, it is so easy to learn!

You plant the Italian vine,
you crush the Italian grape,
you make the Italian wine,
You fill orders crate by crate.

But before I start writing more idiotic poetry, I'll say that it is a bit like Power Grid (though Viti usually doesn't take as long); surprisingly easy to learn, surprisingly complex strategies can be developed.

Workerplacementspiel für 2-6 Spieler ab 13 Jahren von Jamey Stegmaier und Alan Stone.

Die Spieler unterhalten ein Weingut, produzieren Weine, geben Führungen und Verköstigungen und erfüllen Aufträge. Das Ziel der erfolgreichste Winzer zu werden, erreicht aber nur, wer all die Möglichkeiten und Pflichten taktisch klug einsetzt und gewissenhaft erfüllt.


Spielvorbereitung:
Das Spielbrett wird in die Tischmitte gelegt, so dass es alle Spieler gut erreichen können - dabei wird noch entschieden, ob die Seite mit oder ohne den aufgedruckten Hilfstexten gewählt wird.
Die Spielkarten werden nach Sorten getrennt gemischt und auf die entsprechenden Ablagefelder des Spielbretts als verdeckte Nachziehstapel abgelegt. Die Lira-Münzen und Weintrauben-Marker werden als Vorrat zur Seite gelegt.
Die Spieler erhalten in ihrer Wunschfarbe alle Spielfiguren, eine Weinkarte "Pinot" (die restlichen Pinot-Karten werden aus dem Spiel genommen) sowie eine zufällige Sommerkarte (gelbe Besucherkarte), 3 Lira (Goldmünzen), stellen ihre Hahnfigur zur Leiste der Spielerreihenfolge, die Weinflaschenfigur auf das Feld für die jährlichen Auszahlungen und die Korkenfigur auf Feld 0 der Siegpunktleiste. Sie erhalten ferner eine Spielertafel und können zum Spielstart hin von ihren Figuren 2 Arbeiter und den Großarbeiter nutzen, der Rest wird im Spiel nach und nach angeschafft/gekauft und zunächst beiseite gelegt.
Auf ihrer Spielertafel sind zu Beginn die 3 Felder, die (Kelter-)Bottiche und der kleine Keller zur Nutzung freigeschaltet.

Um den Startspieler zu bestimmen, werden die Hahn-Spielfiguren von einem Spieler genommen und in den geschlossenen Händen gut durchgeschüttelt und eine Figur zufällig herausgelassen - der zugehörige Spieler wird Startspieler und erhält den Weintraubenmarker (Startspielermarker).


Spielziel:
Als Erster mindestens 20 Siegpunkte zu erreichen!


Spielablauf:
Das Spiel verläuft über mehrere Runden und jede Runde ist saisonal unterteilt in Frühling, Sommer, Herbst und Winter. Jede Saison bietet dabei unterschiedliche Aktionsmöglichkeiten und diese 4 Phasen müssen immer in gleicher Reihenfolge ausgeführt werden.

Hinweise:
Bei allen (Sommer- und Winter-)Aktionen, bei denen ein Arbeiter eingesetzt wird, gilt es die Spielerzahl zu beachten, denn nur bei 4-6 Spielern können alle drei Felder der Aktionsbereiche genutzt werden, ansonsten nur die beiden linken Einsetzfelder. Dabei muss ein dort eingebrachter Arbeiter immer auf das erste freie Feld von links gesetzt werden!
Das mittlere Feld bringt so dem zweiten dort eingesetzten Arbeiter einen Bonus, z.B. eine Vergünstigung beim Gebäudekauf oder extra Geld oder eine zusätzliche Karte, u.a. - ein weiterer Grund genau zu planen und zu beobachten, wann man eigene Arbeiter wo einsetzen kann^^.

Der Großarbeiter wird wie ein normaler Arbeiter eingesetzt, nur, dass er auch auf Feldern eingesetzt werden kann, die eigentlich schon besetzt sind! Allerdings erhalten sie dabei keinen Bonus, wenn es das 2. Feld wäre.

Besucherkarten können nur ausgespielt werden, wenn der ausführende Spieler in der Lage ist, alle dort angegebenen Effekte und/oder Bedingungen auch zu erfüllen (Bsp.: "gib allen Mitspielern 2 Lira, um einen bestimmten Bonus zu erhalten" und der Spieler hat nicht genug Geld für alle, darf er die Karte nicht ausspielen)!

1) Frühling
Die Frühjahrsmüdigkeit wird hier abgeworfen und beginnend beim Startspieler entscheiden die Spieler wann sie "aufstehen" wollen und platzieren entsprechend ihren "Hahn" auf der dazugehörigen Leiste am linken Spielbrettrand. Als Erster "aufzustehen" und auf dem Hof zu arbeiten, bringt durchaus Vorteile, kann man doch so von allen Aktionen wählen, ohne das ein Mitspieler ein Aktionsfeld blockiert. Andererseits bietet die spätere Platzierung auf der Leiste bestimmte (dort jeweils aufgedruckte) Boni, wie z.B. extra Geld oder das zusätzliche Ziehen von Besucherkarten, u.a.
Es gilt also von Anfang zu überlegen bzw. vorauszuschauen, was man zu tun gedenkt und was die Mitspieler wohl vorhaben könnten.

2) Sommer
Die warmen Sonnenstrahlen verleiten zum aktiven Arbeiten und so können die Spieler hier nun, beginnend beim Startspieler und dann abwechselnd, jeder einen ihrer Arbeiter auf einem der (gelben) Sommer-Aktionsfelder einsetzen und den zugehörigen Effekt sofort nutzen, bis die Spieler all ihre Arbeiter eingesetzt oder gepasst haben.

- (gelbe) Besucherkarte ausspielen; ein Arbeiter, der hier platziert wird, erlaubt dem Spieler eine Besucherkarte auszuspielen und deren Effekt direkt auszuführen, anschliessend wird die Karte abgelegt.
[Bonus beim 2. Feld: eine weitere Besucherkarte ausspielen]

- Weinkarte ziehen; hier darf eine Weinkarte gezogen werden - es sollten immer genügend Weine zur Verfügung stehen, damit man flexibel anbauen und schneller Aufträge erfüllen kann.
[Bonus beim 2. Feld: eine weitere Weinkarte ziehen]

- Besucherführung; für die Tour über den Hof erhält der Spieler sofort 2 Lira.
[Bonus beim 2. Feld: 1 weitere Lira]

- Gebäude errichten; es darf ein Gebäude auf dem Spielertableau gebaut werden. Die Kosten stehen dazu bei der jeweiligen Gebäudeabbildung auf der Spielertafel. Die Gebäude bringen allerhand Vorteile und manche sind gar nötig, um mehr Wein anbauen und lagern zu können. Daher sollte gerade zu Spielbeginn auf ein gut gedecktes Konto geachtet werden^^.
[Bonus beim 2. Feld: die Kosten reduzieren sich um 1]

Gebäude:

- Rankgestell; manche Trauben möchten eben hängen und genau dafür ist dieses Gestell gedacht und erlaubt fortan auch Weine anzupflanzen, die dies voraussetzen.

- Windmühle; die Windmühle bringt dem Spieler 1 Siegpunkt ein, wenn er Weintrauben pflanzt - den Punkt gibt es aber nur 1x pro Jahr.

- Joch; dieses Gespann erlaubt dem Spieler einen Arbeiter auf seiner Spielertafel unterzubringen, anstatt auf dem Spielbrett. Dazu gibt es unter der zugehörigen Grafik auf der Spielertafel auch einen Stellplatz - die Aktion zählt ganz normal als solche, wie die anderen auch. Der Effekt ist im Sommer und im Winter nutzbar!
Im Sommer erlaubt es das "Ausreissen" einer Weinrebe - eine beliebige Weinkarte kann vom Feld zurück auf die Hand genommen werden.
Im Winter erlaubt es das "Abernten" eines Feldes, ganz gleich der regulären Aktion auf dem Spielbrett im Winter.

So hat der Spieler die Möglichkeit, zusätzliche Aktionen zu wählen, wenn z.B. im Winter schon die entsprechenden Aktionsfelder auf dem Spielbrett besetzt sind.

- Bewässerung; manche Weine können ohne diese extra Bewässerung nicht angebaut werden, daher lohnt die Errichtung im Laufe des Spiels schon allein, um an die wertigeren Reben zu gelangen.

- Verköstigungsraum; dient zum Probieren der Weine und bringt dem Spieler bei der Aktion "Besucherführung" 1 Siegpunkt zum regulären Verdienst ein, da die Besucher nun auch trinken und nicht nur gucken können^^.

- Landhaus; sobald das Landhaus gebaut wurde, darf der Spieler während der Herbstphase 2 statt 1 Besucherkarte nach Wahl ziehen.

- Kellerräume; um mehr und vor allem wertvolleren Wein lagern zu können, werden größere und bessere Kellerräume benötigt. Diese werden in zwei Stufen ausgebaut, zuerst mit dem mittleren und dann dem großen Kellerraum.

- Wein anpflanzen; es darf eine Weinkarte auf eines der drei Felder auf der Spielertafel abgelegt werden. Liegt schon eine Karte auf einem Feld, kann dort die neue Karte leicht versetzt mit aufgelegt werden, bis zu insgesamt 6 Weinkarten pro Feld.
Es gilt evtl. Vorgaben zu beachten, z.B. ob eine Bewässerung für die anzubauende Weinsorte nötig ist.
Die Weinkarten verbleiben auf den Feldern bis zum Ende des Spiels! Eine Weinrebe kann nur entfernt werden, wenn ein spezielle Aktion ("Ausreissen") zur Verfügung steht!
[Bonus beim 2. Feld: eine weitere Weinkarte "anpflanzen"]

- Trauben verkaufen; es kann hier eine beliebige Menge an Trauben(-markern) veräußert werden. Der Verdienst richtet sich dabei nach dem Wert der Trauben (1, 2, 3 = 1 Lira; 4, 5, 6 = 2 Lira; 7, 8, 9 = 3 Lira). Die Traubenmarker kommen dann zurück in den Vorrat.
[Bonus beim 2. Feld: 1 Siegpunkt]

3) Herbst
Im Herbst werden bereitwillige Besucher eingeladen auf dem Hof zu helfen. Die Spieler ziehen jeder, beginnend beim Startspieler, eine Sommer- oder Winter-Karte auf die Hand. Wer über das Landhaus verfügt, darf 2 Karten auf einmal ziehen.

4) Winter
Winterzeit, Erntezeit. Nun werden die Spieler die Früchte ihrer bisherigen Arbeit einbringen und nutzen dazu die blauen Aktionsfelder des Spielplans.

- Weinauftragskarte ziehen; hier kann eine der lila-farbenen Auftragskarten gezogen werden. Diese geben oben links die Anzahl und Sorte (in Form bestimmter Weinglas-Symbole) der Weine an, die geliefert werden muss (die passend lagernden Weinmarker in den Kellerräumen werden dazu abgegeben) und unten den Verdienst in Lira und Siegpunkten.

- Feld abernten; es wird ein Feld ausgewählt und dessen Trauben abgeerntet, dabei bleiben die Weinkarten liegen und nur die Summe der auf den Karten angegebenen roten und weißen Trauben wird zusammengezählt und per Traubenmarkern auf den Bottichen der Spielertafel festgehalten.
[Bonus beim 2. Feld: ein weiteres Feld abernten]

Bsp.: Feld 1 wird abgeerntet und dort liegen ein Trebiano (2 weiß), ein Sauvignon Blanc (3 weiß), ein Cabernet Sauvignon (3 rot) und ein Chardonnay (4 weiß) aus, daraus ergibt sich eine Summe von 9 weiß und 3 rot und entsprechend wird ein Traubenmarker auf Feld 9 des Bottiches für Weißweine und ein Traubenmarker auf Feld 3 des Bottiches für Rotweine gelegt.

Sollte das Zielfeld auf einem Kelter-Bottich belegt sein, wurden etwas minderwertigere Trauben geerntet und der Marker auf das nächst niedrigere freie Feld abgelegt.

- Zusatz-Verdienst; im Winter ist es zu kalt für eine Tour über den Hof, daher werden hier nun keine Besucher herumgeführt, sondern Arbeiter quasi freigestellt. Auf dem Karren ist genug Platz für eine beliebige Anzahl an Arbeiterfiguren und jeder hier abgestellte Arbeiter bringt sofort 1 Lira ein - praktisch, wenn man Arbeiter übrig hat.
[kein Bonus]

- Arbeiter trainieren; hier werden für 4 Lira neue Arbeiter angeworben, d.h. unbedarfte Helfer zum Weinbauern umgeschult^^. Ab der nächsten Runde steht dem Spieler eine weitere Arbeiterfigur zur Verfügung.
[Bonus beim 2. Feld: die Kosten werden um 1 reduziert]

- (blaue) Besucherkarte ausspielen; ein Arbeiter, der hier platziert wird, erlaubt dem Spieler eine Besucherkarte auszuspielen und deren Effekt direkt auszuführen, anschliessend wird die Karte abgelegt.
[Bonus beim 2. Feld: eine weitere Besucherkarte ausspielen]

- Wein herstellen; hier werden die gesammelten Trauben aus den Bottichen in Wein umgewandelt - also lecker zerstampft und gepresst und gekeltert und abgefüllt^^. Dazu wird ein Traubenmarker auf ein gleichwertiges Feld im Keller abgelegt.
[Bonus auf dem 2. Feld: einen weiteren Wein "herstellen"]

Bsp.: der Spieler möchte die roten Trauben, Wert 6, in einen Rotwein wandeln und legt dazu den Traubenmarker vom Bottichfeld auf Feld 6 für Rotwein im Keller (dabei wird eigentlich der Traubenmarker entfernt und ein Weinmarker in den Keller gelegt, aber es ist dasselbe Spielmaterial^^).

Höherwertige Weine können allerdings auch nur in entsprechend ausgebauten Kellerräumen gelagert werden! Bevor also ein Traubenkompott zu einem Wein gemengt wird, sollte auch der entsprechende Lagerplatz vorhanden (ausgebaut worden) sein^^!

Um Rosé- und Schaumweine herstellen zu können, müssen Trauben gemischt werden.
Für einen Rosé werden ein roter und ein weißer Traubenmarker, die zusammen mindestens einen Wert von 4 erreichen, abgegeben und 1 Weinmarker auf dem entsprechenden Rosé-Feld abgelegt.
Für einen Sekt werden zwei rote und ein weißer Traubenmarker, die zusammen mindestens einen Wert von 7 erreichen, abgegeben und 1 Weinmarker auf dem entsprechenden Sekt-Feld abgelegt.
Lagernde Weine können niemals kombiniert werden!

Sollte das anvisierte Weinfeld im Keller schon belegt sein, muss der neue Wein auf dem nächst-niedrigeren freien Feld abgelegt werden - dieser wurde dann etwas minderwertiger abgefüllt.

- Weinauftrag erfüllen; wenn die auf der entsprechenden Auftrags-Karte vorgegebenen Weine in den Kellerräumen des Spielers lagern, kann er diese abgeben (Marker in den Vorrat zurück) und erfüllt damit den Auftrag. Der auf der Karte angegebene Verdienst wird sofort ausgezahlt, d.h. Siegpunkte werden direkt vermerkt und der jährlich auszuschüttende Gewinn wird auf dem entsprechenden Feld rechts unten auf dem Spielplan markiert (Lira-Symbol mit den Zahlen 1-5 drumherum).

Am Ende des Jahres, wenn der letzte Spieler seine letzte Aktion im Winter ausgeführt oder gepasst hat, kommt es zur Abrechnung.
Alle Weintrauben und Weine altern um den Wert 1 und altern heißt hier sie verbessern sich im Wert - so werden auch zuvor evtl. minderwertigere Weine (wg. Platzmangel) wieder zu den gehofft Guten - solange die entsprechenden Kellerräume für die nun "besseren" Weine vorhanden sind!
Alle Arbeiter kehren zu ihren Besitzern zurück und Spieler, die eine jährliche Zahlung, aufgrund erfüllter Weinaufträge, zu erhalten haben, bekommen nun ihre verdienten Lira ausgezahlt (entsprechend der Position auf der die Weinflaschenfigur des Spielers steht). Die Handkarten werden auf 7 reduziert und der Startspielermarker wandert zum nächsten Spieler im Uhrzeigersinn und eine neue Runde beginnt.


Spielende:
Das Spiel geht in die Endphase, sobald ein Spieler mindestens das Feld "20" auf der Punkteleiste erreicht bzw. überquert. Die laufende Runde wird noch zu Ende gespielt (bis zum Jahresende) und dann gewinnt der Spieler, der das höchste Punktfeld erreicht hat.


Fazit:
"Viticulture" ist ein genial umgesetztes Workerplacement-Spiel und bringt dabei das Thema rund um den Wein nicht nur gestalterisch sehr gut zu den Spielern herüber!
Die Atmosphäre des toskanischen Umfeldes wird durch die Grafiken, welche nicht nur hübsch und detailliert sind, sondern in ihrer Gesamtheit einem Gemälde gleichkommen, wunderbar transportiert, so dass man sich wirklich einem Weingut und den Rebstöcken nahe fühlt.

Die Spielabläufe sind sehr gut ineinander verzahnt und die Idee die 4 Phasen als Jahreszeiten zu vermarkten ist wirklich gelungen, da die damit einhergehenden Möglichkeiten auch tatsächlich in etwa so in der Weingut-Realität vorkommen (können).
Dadurch, dass die Aktionen in den Runden abwechselnd von den Spielern durchgeführt werden, kommt auch nie wirklich Langatmigkeit auf und somit bleibt die Spielmotivation durchgehend erhalten - selbst bei lästigen Extremgrüblern fällt dies nicht so schwer ins Gewicht, da auch das Beobachten der Mitspielertätigkeiten durchaus vorteilhaft für die eigenen Vorhaben sein kann. Alle Aktionen wollen daher gut überlegt und vorausgeplant sein, da die Mitspieler i.d.R. gleiches im Schilde führen^^.
Man kann "Viticulture" daher gut als Vielspieler-Spiel einstufen, für die erfahreneren Zocker unter uns. Bei entsprechend guter Erklärbär-Einführung sollten aber auch Gelegenheitsspieler durchaus "hineinfinden" können - hierfür gibt es ja dann auch die mit Hilfstexten bedruckten Seiten des Spielplans und der Spielertafeln.

Das Studium der Regeln kann sich hie und da etwas schwierig gestalten, da leicht ein unübersichtlicher Eindruck entsteht, wenn die Anleitung nicht sehr genau gelesen wird. Viele Abläufe und das Spielverständnis an sich klären sich erst nach Beendigung des Heftes bzw. bei nochmaligen Nachlesen einiger Passagen.
Dabei ist das Regelheft nicht schlecht geschrieben, nur vllt. etwas ungewohnt strukturiert^^.

Das Material verdient eine Erwähnung mit einem eigenen Absatz^^, nicht nur sind die Grafiken (auf den Spielbrettern und Karten) sehr gelungen (s.o.), sondern auch die vielen einzelnen Spielfiguren. Sehr ungewöhnlich und bei anderen Spielen wünschenswert, dass alle Spieler für alle Möglichkeiten eigene Spielfiguren erhalten - der Produktionsaufwand hierfür muss entsprechend groß gewesen sein. Insgesamt ist dabei auch noch alles sehr wertig gelungen! Auch die "Glas"steine machen etwas her, da so immer noch die Werte auf den Feldern durch sie hindurch gelesen werden kann.

Die optische Vielfalt wird auch durch die vielen abwechslungsreichen Möglichkeiten gestützt, welche die Besucherkarten mit sich bringen. Bis diese alle, in den möglichen Varianten verschiedener Spielabläufe, wirklich durchgespielt und erlebt worden sind, vergehen viele Spielrunden.

So bleibt diesem ausgezeichnet konzipiertem Spiel nur eine Kaufempfehlung an alle auszusprechen, die das Thema reizvoll finden und sich spielerisch bereit sehen, viele Stunden mit dem Weingut auseinanderzusetzen, denn einmal gespielt und verinnerlicht, wird "Viticulture" immer wieder seinen Weg auf den Tisch zurückfinden !

(first off, apologies if this should be in the Tuscany forum - I've lost track of which visitors are from Viticulture, and which - from Tuscany)

Here's a situation from today's game:

Three player game. Yellow has picked row 3 of turn order, purple has row 5 and white has row 6. When it's white's turn in summer, they play Organizer and move to row 4. Does yellow take the next turn because everyone's now taken an equal number of turns in the current season? Or does purple take the next turn because white just took a turn and purple is now the next player after white?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'd say move to the player who was next after the original position of the player. It doesn't make sense to give such a benefit to a player who didn't play the card (purple in your example), and penalize other people who are now just before the moved player (yellow).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Organizer has you move to the next season to avoid confusing situations like this (it says so on the card). Since you move to the next season by playing it, yellow and purple continue to take turns in the current season while you wait for them to pass.

I wonder if the Tuscany Expansion will be added!! (I know.... asking for the world, but...)

I think we'll add various elements of Tuscany one by one.

I don't wanna jinx it, but I have happily noticed that Viticulture has been slowly, but surely, climbing the charts. It has been in the 2nd page of the general rankings (top 200) for pretty long, it is now (06/26/15) up at #130, and has a strong average rating of 7.80 - beating 47 of the top 100 games as of now, and tied with one of them.

The tied game (
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
, #72 with 4045 ratings) suggests that, if the average stands, Viti would need around a thousand more ratings to comfortably make it to the top 100 (it's 1300 ratings short of SHCD).

With two print runs mostly sold out, the addition of
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
to the mix, and the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
close in the horizon, I think there's a pretty fair chance that we will see Viticulture crack the top 100 within the next few months.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I hope so because this game deserves it.

I read about the reprint today, but I also saw that Tuscany will not be reprinted at least in the same format as this run.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I watch the ratings too, and I have to say it would be pretty cool to break into the top 100.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1424177:
I'd really like to get this game and the Tuscany expansion, but it seems to be out of print. Before I spend way more than I should on a third party, does anyone know if there will be another print run anytime soon?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not sure if the eta, but I know they are actively working on a new print run.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jason: We'll be announcing details about this in our September 1 e-newsletter next week. The short answer is: Yes, Viticulture will have a new print run being released in late November, but you should probably buy Tuscany now.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ahh, so the new print run won't be a "Game of the Year" edition that includes the expansion? I guess I could get Tuscany now and stare at it for three months...

Is there any benefit to ordering it from the Stonemaier Games website vs a retailer?

Edit: I just read the "Give us a new Kickstarter" thread and it answered my original question about a big box combo. I'd pay $120 for it, but I'm probably in the minority.

Scooping up Tuscany now, but I'd still like to know if there's a benefit to ordering direct from your site.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, it would cost way too much if we combined both of them. Yeah, $120 is a lot of money to spend on one game.

I'd recommend buying Tuscany at the best price you can get it, wherever you can get it. Though, wait until September 1 to read the update before making your decision, just so you have all the information.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just subscribed for the newsletter. LOL...newbie
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamey,
I think/hope that by the above you mean:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I get the impression from posts here at BGG that the reprint of Viticulture will be a fairly straight reprint. But I'm hoping that I'm wrong, and that it will include the solo variant...

Andrew

ps "all the expansions in Tuscany" sounds like a BGG version of "all the tea in China." Example: "I wouldn't play CAH again, not for all the expansions in Tuscany."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew: You'll see on Tuesday.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I missed the Kickstarter but when the remaining units of the collector's edition appeared on Amazon I was a bit hesitant at the £100 asking price. But I went ahead anyway and I have to say I don't regret the decision one bit. Fantastic game with beautiful components. And probably the game my girlfriend wants to play the most. So if you get the chance to get a copy, or standalone Viticulture + Tuscany + metal coins I'd say snap them up
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, I'm glad to hear that! The current version of Viticulture and Tuscany will remain the official versions of the game after Tuesday's announcement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So any way to get the promo cards in the near future?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There used to be a few visitor card promos, but they're in every copy of Tuscany now (they're packaged with the Arboriculture expansion). We also have a promo card for game reviewer Joel Eddy (it's a Papa card), but it's just an alternate art version of another card. We give them out at conventions, and Joel might include them on next year's Drive Thru Review campaign.

My viticulture 2.0 came with a broken blue worker, a broken blue large wine cellar, a broker yellow cottage and a missing yellow rooster... do anyone know if there's a place you can get replacement parts for this game?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I had a broken piece and I just glued it back together with wood glue.

The normal thing to do for missing or damaged components is to contact the publisher, they will usually rectify the problem.

A H: I'm sorry to hear that those pieces arrived damaged (and the missing rooster). Byron posted the link above (thanks Byron) for you to let us know where to send the pieces, and we'll take care of it. Hopefully this won't happen to you again, but as fortheloveofdice mentioned, typically all you have to do is go to the publisher's website and they'll have a form set up to get you the pieces as soon as possible--we want you to have a complete, unblemished game!

Hilo ID 1415088:
I have a around 15 2p games of viticulture, and I'm starting to think the wine order cards are completely unbalanced.

My main issue is with the 2 VP orders.

Why are the 2 VP cards even in the game? Why would anyone ever complete them: they cost ~4 actions to complete (get the order, harvest, make wine, deliver), the same as almost any other order card, and offer a measly return. The problem here is not the number of actions, is that all those actions are the highly contested ones( especially the make wine, and deliver order)

A 4VP order, offers twice the benefit, for the measly additional cost of having a medium cellar. A medium cellar that you only build once and profit for your next 3-5 orders.

A 2 vp order is not only a dead action, a dead card, but you drawing it, increases the chance of you opponent avoiding one.

Being able to complete a low value orders without an action (like the quests are completed in Lords of Waterdeep), would really make them more valuable, without making them op, otherwise I'm seriously considering leaving them in the box.

The 3VP cards are not great either, but there are a lot more of them, and there is a big change that both you and your opponent will draw a 1-2 of those.

I kindof-understand why the designer added them in the game. In a 3+ player game, they probably aren't so bad because of the (+1 wine making and +1 VP when fulfilling orders action spaces), but a 2p, I just can't possibly justify their existence.


I hope someone can prove me wrong, because otherwise Viticulture is a good 2p, but it seams that the winner is the one that manages to draw the 'biggest' orders.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You make some good points, but completely disregard the income wine orders give. Getting an early income going can be very valuable, and is a lot easier with low value orders than medium or high value orders. Therefore I do not completely agree with your valuation of the order cards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't have the cards in front of me but most of the higher VP cards tend to require the medium and large cellar to be built. Many more actions than those needed for an early 2 VP.

The way i see it, this is another iteration of the "some visitor cards are better than the others" claim. But Viticulture to me is not meant to be "perfectly balanced", in terms of cards.

A big part of the game design relies on the luck of the draw. Drawing wine contracts, or visitors, should be risky. it's part of the game, and some cards are going to be less useful than others at some point. That forces players to adapt and play the best of what they are dealt. Removing those cards will severely undermine the part of the game design, in my opinion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is why you have to play with the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
expansion, which lets you trade your "dead" cards for more useful things like more cards, money, VP, or grapes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I agree with a lot of the points made above. I think, based on only 3 games so far admittedly (2 of them 2p), that you may not often want to spend the time on fulfilling a 2vp order but with 2 exceptions:

1. Early game to try and jump a lead on your opponent
2. To end the game at the right moment (i.e. when your scoring is ahead of your opponent's)

I don't agree with one of the above posters that higher value orders take lots more actions. Surely part of any decent strategy is to make sure that medium and large cellars are built in good time so as to allow the wines to age.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
High-value orders require high-value grapes (for red and white) or multiple grapes (for blush and sparkling). There is not enough time in a well-played game to get low-value grapes into a high-valued red or white. So, whether it is the extra actions of building the buildings that let you plant high-value grapes, or th4e extra harvest to get multiple low-value grapes, you do spend more actions to produce a high-value wine.

I agree that high-value wine orders seem a little more efficient than low-value, but they do take more actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well it's impossible to argue at what standard we're playing the game, but so far to get to 25+ points and finish the game we're completing a decent number of orders and it takes time. But what I said is still true in that it is not taking an action for grapes and wine to age. If you've got 2 fields producing 3 or 4 red and white grapes then with a couple of decent turns and taking the "age grapes" space you could be getting high value red/white/blush/sparkling in a relatively short space of time.

3 fields: 1 with red 2, one with red 3 and one with white 3. You harvest. How long before I can create a bottle of 8 sparkling? Not very long! And not very many actions either!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm sure you can see where I would disagree with the first statement and agree with the second.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quite long, because you can't create blush without a medium cellar or sparkling without a medium and a large cellar, which are expensive in lira and actions. ALso, the fields cost you actions to plant, and the harvests cost you actions (speaking of which, those are not efficient fields, if you put the red 3 and the white 3 together you would save an action harvesting).

I've not tried it (not drawn the right vine/order combos), but I'd be interested to see how possible it would be to plant, harvest, crush, sell with the opening four actions for a cheap order and get a bit of income early on which could really mount up and save you on sell/tour actions, and see how that would affect the game. If it saved you even half a worker-action every round (not impossible) it might be worth doing over buying an extra worker for 4 lira.

Also... 'age grapes' isn't a space. It's one or two visitors in the base game, so you have to get quite lucky to be able to artificially age your grapes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ah, I was playing whatever edition/expansion that the 5th role includes an 'age grape' action when moving to another season.

Hilo ID 1413068:
I started to respond to the Blind leading the blind thread, but since my post got so long, I figured I would just put it in a separate thread.

Here are my strategy tips in order of importance:

1) Maximize your worker output
You should always strive to get the most actions out of your workers. A typical beginner mistake is e.g. to use up four workers to end up with one Pinot planted and nothing else. Consider what the net result of your actions for the year will be and replan if it seems to be too little. It may be that other players get in the way of your plans, but still consider what your best options are for the long term play. For instance, getting two purple cards even if you already have two good ones on your hand may be a better use of your worker than getting the sixth worker for 4 Lira; or, planting just one Sagniovese with your worker seems weak - you may want to look for better options and make the planting move next year when you can get the planting bonus.

2) Crisis management vs long term perspective
You will eventually experience a crisis in one of yoru games - getting cards that are of no use for you - you get the 6th white grape when you are waiting for a red, your orders don't match your wines in the cellar, you get blocked out of important plays.

The key is to not allow this to happen in the first place.

If this happens towards the end of the game where you can't do anything about it it means that you don't have a variety of grapes AND don't have a variety of wine orders AND you don't have windmill/tasting room to give you a steady VP increase. This means you have been playing wrong from the start. Keep a variety of something on your hand/estate at all times - visitors, orders, grapes. Don't let yourself get into the position where you filled your last order and you have NOTHING to do next except hoping you'll get an order that fits your wares.

If this "crisis" is happening at the beginning of the game, don't panic, everything is fine. You may want to grab the windmill and/or the tasting room as this is a fail-safe way to get VPs for the next turns and grab more visitor cards and/or order cards and see where it gets you; consider producing grapes without turning them into wines yet and leave yourself the option of producing roses and sparkling wines when a suitable order card comes, you may even sell grapes to grab the bonus VP on the way.

3) Don't overestimate the value of money
The worth of 3 Lira is about 1 VP as evidenced by some of the visitor cards and game mechanics. This means that getting 1 Lira is most often a weak move, even in the beginning of the game when you need Lira to build up your estate. Plan your expenditures ahead and make wineyard tours preemptively. Avoid getting in the position where you are just 1 Lira short of important buildings and waste your workers or the rooster on a weak "get 1 Lira" move.

4) Number of workers
It's always necessary to get the 4th worker. Get him in the first couple of rounds for the best return. The 5th worker is almost always worth it in 3 and 5 player games where there's more space on the board. Getting the 5th worker in 2,4 and 6 player games or the 6th worker in 3 and 5 player games depends on whether you think you can get something out of him. If you are running the windmill/tasting room/grape selling strategy, the extra workers are usually worth it. If you are mostly fulfulling orders and/or playing visitors, there's usually a better move for you than getting the extra worker that will not bring much value.

5) The wake up order
IMO there is a slight unbalance on the original board that has been addressed to some extent in the expansion:
- the 1 Lira is too low in the order - as mentioned in 3), getting one Lira is too weak of a play
- the purple card is too high - getting new orders is good and you'll be high in the turn order
- going first is strong - you'll be collecting the bonus fields on the board which is typically stronger than any single bonus from the wake up order (if you can make use of the bonus fields of course)
- don't forget the bonus VP - it's approprietly low in the turn order, but don't overlook it, remember the 1 VP to 3 Lira ratio - this is a strong bonus
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I agree with the idea that the +1gold spot is particularly. More often than not, you're better off taking the first spot with no bonus, since you'll be able to grab the bonus spots that provide +1 gold. Of course there's no guarantee that spot will be available but in the few games I've played so far it generally is.

There's also the possibility that you might need the rooster +1 and the bonus +1 in order to afford something (ie training a worker but only having 2 gold) but it's pretty unlikely you'd get the spot being so low on the order and thus have to save your Grande for it, hoping that it's not completely full.

While moving up the +1 gold rooster spot in the order makes sense, perhaps an easier fix might be to make it +2 gold, since that would just involve a sticker on the spot. That should provide enough of an extra benefit to take that spot early, without making it too much better than the +1vp spot below it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1411058:
As each field can be harvested only once per year, do you use any additional mechanism to keep track of which fields have been harvested?

If you harvest in the summer using the yoke, and then also (much later) in the winter, AND you are evaluating different options or just in general have a busy mind, it seems quite easy to harvest the same field twice by mistake. Or is this never a problem in practice? (I have not yet played the game.)

I was thinking that it would be possible to put one or two grape tokens on the field itself, depending on if it has one or two grape colors. Harvesting then means to take the tokens from field to the crush pad. The field tokens would have to be refilled at the end of the year. One drawback of this is that it ties up quite a number of tokens just for keeping track of not yet harvested fields.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I suppose it's not a bad idea to mark which fields have been harvested as a reminder but we never have. In practice it's not hard to remember which fields have been harvested. In my experience, you will typically only end up doing that action once per year whether you use the board, the yoke, or a card. Thinking about it now, it wouldn't usually be a very good use of your available actions to use two (or more) of them for harvesting.

That's not a very scientific response to your question but those are my initial thoughts.

When I use these cards, I must always pay at least 1 lira to build even if discount is higher/on par with the price of structure, right ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nope. If there is a minimum payment required it would either be in the rules (it isn't, IIRC) or on the card (I don't know the exact card you are referring to, but I'm sure that it isn't on the card either).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hm, I tought that the words with discount by itself implicitly excludes 'for free'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've always taken this to mean that the structure can be free. I think that the rules would have made a point of stating if that wasn't the case.

In celebration of the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I’m publishing the Official Viticulture Solo Challenge #2 today.

Like with
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the goal is to explore new strategies in the game and compete with each other for the high score.

If you try out the challenge then please post your score to this thread, so that you can compete on who can get the highest score. Posting pictures or session (brief or long) is also encouraged, but not required.

When playing this challenge use the following expansion modules from Tuscany (same as last time)
Automa
Mamas & Papas
New visitors
Advanced visitors
Properties
Extended board
Structures

Replace the old visitor cards as described on the bottom of page 7 of the Tuscany rulebook and remove cards that only give you a benefit if other players take an action (or simply discard and draw a new one when you draw one of them).

For this challenge play with the following rule changes:
At any time you can loan as many lira as you want.
At the end of the game you must pay back all you’ve borrowed. If you’re unable to do so, your VP score is reset to 0.

If you play then let us know how much you borrowed and how many VP you scored.

Right now I'm looking for a game with depth, that isn't insanely long. Replayability is important, as well as lack of redundancy (I want something that allows you to have a lot of choices/ways to win that is enjoyable). I like how this hits on each topic (because I dislike how games go from GREAT to okay depending if you play with 3 or 4) like scaleability as well.

It is a long of a read but for those interested are these points true?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. If the game ends by certain people reaching a # of victory points, and you can't "check" the leading person to slow them down, how does one make a come back?

2. Does this game scale well regardless of # of players?

3. How do you feel about the replayability? Is it truly more enjoyable than stone age ETC. the other games he listed?

4. I dunno what to ask in regard to this point.

5. Thoughts?

6. Does "hungry for more" mean you feel incomplete/not satisfied/not full after you play?



How do each of these points relate to the base game, and does the Tuscany expansion make these points better, as in more true?

Thanks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My replies pertain to Viticulture + Tuscany w/ all tier 1 & 2 modules. I have never played the base game.

1. You can slow other people down by taking the spot they want to go to, assuming you are higher in turn order. You can also make a comeback by having a big turn and filling multiple wine orders, assuming you've planned right and/or have applicable visitor cards.

2. I've played 3,4,5,6 and it has worked well. 5 is probably my favorite because it opens up the extra slot. 6 would be my least favorite. I think it scales pretty well and would be happy to play it at any player count.

3. Replayability is very good. Between the 5 different types of cards, variable starting resources and different special workers, the game is different enough not to feel samey every time. I haven't played Stone Age or Agricola.

5. I like the turn order mechanism. If you really want to go first use up all your workers and pass early, or plan ahead and get the extra worker. Going earlier in the turn order means you'll probably get a bonus spot, but you'll get less when passing out of a season. There is no best spot to go in, it's usually situational.

6. Typical games at the higher player counts take ~2 hours. I'm usually pretty satisfied after a play.

I love board games. I love the strategy and decisions that go into them, and especially, I love that I can have fun while thinking. My gateway game was the Settlers of Catan, and my favorites are kind of all over the board with a range from Puerto Rico to Space Hulk. So that's me - a background about my opinions - my reviews follow the same format every time, because these are the criteria I like to think about when I'm looking at purchasing a game. Feel free to check out my other reviews.http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/browse/boardgame/0?usern... And now I'd like to take a look at the strategic game of winemaking (not whinemaking) – Viticulture.

I originally owned the first edition of Viticulture, but sold it and picked up a copy of the Collector’s Edition of Viticulture with the Tuscany expansion. For review purposes, I’ll be talking about both Viticulture and Tuscany – and I’ll explain why in detail later, but it’s essentially because I will never separate the base game and the expansion again.

1. The Components
The original edition of Viticulture had great components. The board is colorful and attractive, yet functional. Each player has many unique “meeples” to represent their workers, the different structures they can build, and more. The Collector’s edition just took this quality off the hook. The game included some of Stonemaier’s excellent metal coins, which are amazing. I have since taken them out of Viticulture and use them for any game with coins because they just really look great. In addition to being metal, the coins have a great wash applied to them to bring out the detail and give them a weathered look. Be aware though that the metal coins, as far as I know, are only included in the Collector’s Edition of Viticulture, but can be purchased separately as well.

Getting back on track, the game includes individual player boards that help track the structures and such that you’ve built over the course of the game. There are also a load of mini cards with attractive art and great function.
Looking to Tuscany, you can see why Tuscany is a more expensive expansion than you may be used to. Tuscany is structured like a “legacy style” expansion wherein the players add additional modules over time based upon which player had won the last game. These expansions are tiered (mostly) in order of complexity, giving the players a quick guide as to which expansion modules they can feel comfortable adding. Each of these modules adds little tweaks to the game (some which I like, and some which I could do without). However, the components for these modules are all outstanding. One of the modules is a new board with interesting new spaces that are not that difficult to implement. My favorite though (component wise), is the module that adds “special workers.” Each game with this module adds two types of special workers that players can recruit with diverse special abilities. Each of these special workers has their own special type of meeple, and I think the expansion comes with 11 different special worker meeples for each player. The components represent the outstanding attention to production values that have become a hallmark of Stonemaier Games.

2. The Theme
Players in the game represent winemakers seeking to become the most renowned vintner in the region. Over the course of the game, in addition to planting specific vines to grow wine, players will build different structures and watch their vineyard grow in every respect. Points can be gained in a number of different ways, allowing for players to pursue divergent strategies.

3. The Concept
Mechanically, Viticulture and Tuscany are worker placement games. The designer (who is a fabulous guy all around) has been upfront about the influence that other worker placement game have had on Viticulture. Viticulture seeks to fix some of the issues that players have had with previous well-known worker placement games. Whether you feel the designer succeeded or not I think is a matter of personal opinion, but it is important to note that for fans of the worker placement genre, Viticulture is at least worth a play to see how it compares.

Viticulture is also essentially a “race” scoring game, where players are attempting to be the first to get to a certain number of victory points. There are a lot of different strategies that can grant victory points, but the most prominent is the fulfilling of wine orders. Each wine order card will require the player to sacrifice a certain type and value of wine token and the player will gain, in exchange, a number of victory points and usually a residual income that will grant money each turn. There is obviously more to Viticulture, but this is the essential “feeling” of the game.

Tuscany adds, as I’ve mentioned, a lot of different modules. Some of these are minor additions while some are completely game changing. Overall though, Tuscany will keep the basic framework that fans of the worker placement genre will find comforting.

4. The Ending
As I highlighted above, Viticulture is a game where players are attempting to basically be the first player with a certain amount of victory points. Some players may find this “race” aspect off-putting. That will be a matter of taste for different players. I believe there are strengths and weaknesses to the different approaches that designers can take towards the mechanic that brings the end of the game. While I typically like games that go for a set number of rounds better, I like the mechanic used in Viticulture because it requires the players to be more responsive in the way that they play. You’ll need to keep a close eye on your opponents and do your best to stay close to the pack. Most of the games of Viticulture that I’ve played have had a pretty close spread of final scores, but not so close that the rest of the game is irrelevant.

5. The Game play
Viticulture is primarily a worker placement game where players send their workers out to take specific actions each turn. One of the interesting developments or evolutions that Viticulture brings to the worker placement genre is specific “seasons.” In the base game of Viticulture, this means that you’ll gather all of your workers at the beginning of each game round. The round has two placement phases, Summer and Winter, which have largely completely different actions in them. The catch is that you have to spread the use of your workers over both seasons, which leads to some difficult decisions from round to round. As with most typical worker placement games, you have the same feeling in Viticulture that you need to do five to six things but can only do three.

6. Replayability
Base game Viticulture doesn’t have as much variability as some games for completely random set ups every game, but there are divergent strategies that you can take which really help the replayability. These divergent strategies arise from buildings you can build, the vines you draw, the visitors you draw, the wine order cards and more. While base game Viticulture has lots of replayability build right into it, this goes off of the charts when you add Tuscany into the mix.

7. The "Luck" Factor
First edition copies of Viticulture would have scored lower in this category than the new second edition. Some of the visitor cards in first edition were ONLY useful in certain phases of the game, while I think all of these cards have been adjusted in the second edition adding more choices when you play some of the visitor cards. There are certainly some luck elements as far as drawing from the different card decks, but all of those can be mitigated and just serve the purpose of keeping the game interesting. Conclusions: Viticulture was a first release, using Kickstarter from Stonemaier Games. I wasn’t a backer of the first edition, but I was a pre-order customer. I really enjoyed my first edition copy. When second edition came along, I upgraded to the Collector’s Edition with Tuscany included. When looking at Viticulture, second edition of Viticulture is a great worker placement game, one that can go toe to toe with the greats like Caverna, Tzolk’in, and Agricola. However, once you add in Tuscany, which due to its modular nature may take some exploring to find the right combination for your games, the game becomes one of the best games I’ve ever played. There are so many meaningful choices wrapped up into such an accomplishable play-time. One of my favorite aspects is that when you’re playing the game, you build the different structures and place cards on your player board. At the end of the game you’ll look at your player board and just really see all of the things you’ve done, you feel like you’ve accomplished something at the end of the game. Base game Viticulture has a tight economy, but my preferred method of playing is with Tuscany. The new board module specifically adds some very interesting twists onto the economy with the “Trade” space.

As I attempt to articulate exactly why I enjoy Viticulture + Tuscany so much, I find myself at a loss for words. There are so many interlocking systems in Viticulture that all work collectively together to create a game that truly just sings. Viticulture is clearly a Euro game, and while the theme is appealing - the game is primarily about the mechanisms that make the game tick. There are both long-term strategic choices from turn to turn as you seek to fulfill wine orders, and tactical choices as you carefully choose where to send your workers during each turn. Perhaps that is why I enjoy the underlying framework of Viticulture so much. Often games seem to focus more on strategy or tactics but don’t succeed at either for me. Viticulture represents, I think, some of the absolute best parts of each of the most popular individual worker placement games all combined into one fantastic game. For me, as well as for many others, Viticulture began a real love of Stonemaier games. While not explicitly part of the game that comes in the box, it is refreshing to support such a great, fledgling company. We’ll have many more hits from Stonemaier to enjoy in the future, of that I’m sure, and more than that, Stonemaier has repeatedly gone above and beyond to be a wonderful part of the community. I cannot recommend Viticulture (with Tuscany) enough - especially for fans of worker placement games, I think while Viticulture may not bring anything radically new to the genre, it does bring a really well articulated and realized vision.
Please include any thoughts about the review, and as always, Thank you for reading!

Nice post! I too was hooked into modern board gaming because of Catan.

I also have the Collector's Edition, it's beautiful!

Love the game as well!

I'm really excited about this game and bought the base and expansion because of the theme and positive reviews. After reading the rules, there are a couple of places where the theme breaks down for me, and I'm left wondering why the designers chose to do things this way:

A) Making wines involves adding together different "red" and "white" grapes. First, white wine doesn't come from white grapes, but rather has to do with how the grapes are pressed with respect to the skins. Second, why are we mixing reds and whites together to make sparkling and blush wines?

B) Grapes age on the crush pad year to year. Again, hard to understand harvested fruit improving over time.

Any thoughts? I'm just wondering why they couldn't have used more thematic mechanics in these instances.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If I remember correctly Jamey has said that he stated out without the aging grapes, but it made the game much less fun, so he chose to sacrifice the theme in this regard to make the game fun.

Fellow BGG'er
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
suggested that "aging the grapes" become an idiom after I used this as an example on my blog, and I think that it would make a great idiom for situations where a designer has to sacrifice the theme to make the mechanics work.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Word.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Champagne the greatist of all sparkling wines from France is indeed made , for the most part with both.The White grape Chardonnay and red varieties Pinot Noir and to a lesser amount Pinot Meunier.Leaving clear grape juice in contact with green grape skins wont get you much,when making red wine you have long periods of juice to skin contact turnig the liquid red.Most but not all juice from red or white varieties runs clear.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the replies. Thinking of it as a compromise helps a bit, but again with the vast array of mechanisms available (I may be speaking out of turn here as I am definitely NOT a game designer), I wonder if they could have done it differently in these instances. Even a footnote in the manual explaining their choices would have helped.

I suppose grapes aging on the crush pad could be though of in terms of the workers gaining experience with respect to how to best process each variety of grape over time.

The red plus white equals blush will probably continue to bug me a bit, especially because it's a misperception among people that don't drink much wine that this is actually what a blush wine is.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Games as simulations are always imperfect. We're not actually out in the fields picking grapes, etc. There will always be a point where the game and reality part paths... usually this will be done to aid the gameplay. I love the game Agricola but I'm pretty sure I'd hate just about everything about actually farming.

Where you draw the line and say "This bugs me because it's not accurate" is a very personal decision. It sounds like you're a wine snob aficionado who knows more about the actual process of making wine than the average joe. I suspect that if the game tried to be more accurate it would be more confusing to people who lack your knowledge. Trying to explain that you harvest red grapes to make white wine would be a disconnect for a lot of people. Additionally, having to plant and harvest different colors of grapes to make wines builds in more difficulty to the game and makes it more interesting.

I'm okay with the fact that they sacrificed a little accuracy for the sake of fun. If it helps... every time you play you can feel superior to people because you understand the intricacies of wine making while they don't. And when you introduce new people to the game it'll be an opportunity for you to show off your wine knowledge and "correct" the game by explaining how it's really done. And isn't that the point of all knowledge? Lording it over those who lack it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Try playing without the Age Grapes mechanism some time! Not only will you lose a source of income for when you repeatedly get blocked from Tours by those with Tasting Tables, but you'll find that you fall behind if you get blocked from Making Wine too. This one mechanism turns what would be a very unforgiving Worker Placement game into one that is tremendous fun - and one of the few WPs that I will agree to play (one of the others being
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
)

EDIT: really must check post for "typos" before hitting "Submit"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Easy there Bryan. I am not a wine snob, nor am I lording my supposed knowledge over anyone. Seriously, why did you impose all of those negative assumptions onto my post? Why would you think I want to feel superior to anyone else when I play games? Honestly I knew I couldn't possibly post a question like this without at least one person choosing to view it as elitist. I'm guessing now is the time when you say you were just joking because of the smiley face at the end...

To answer your legitimate question about where I draw the line, to me there is a clear difference between a) wanting more detail to make the game more of a simulation (something I am not interested in) versus b) being put off by a conceptual inaccuracy in a game. Many games have clever ways of simplifying complex issues while staying true to the idea they are trying to express. Mixing red and white grapes to make blush wine is a completely different type of "inaccuracy", versus say not having to service and fuel farm equipment used to harvest the grapes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zak: Do you have a question for me that I can help out with? I'm the designer of Viticulture and Tuscany.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Jamey,

Sure. I am just curious about the above mechanism of mixing whites and reds together to make blush and sparkling wines. Was this the original idea or was another mechanism altered or revised to arrive at this one because of some balance or gameplay issue? I am overall quite impressed/pleased with the game, but this specific aspect strikes me as a bit odd. Maybe some context will help me to rationalize it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why not? You should be!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zak: My research indicated that champagne (i.e., sparkling wine in regions other than the Champagne area of France) is typically made from a blend of three types of grapes: chardonnay (white/green), pinot noir (red/purple), and pinot meunier (red/purple).

Ultimately, when designing a game, the goal is for it to be fun. Part of that is that the game is intuitive. Usually the best way to do that is to align the mechanisms with the theme. But sometimes the intuitive thing isn't thematically correct (like grapes aging every year instead of going bad, or blush wine being made from red and white grapes).

As others pointed out in this thread, the entire winemaking process is simplified in Viticulture. There's no maceration or filtering of the skins, no elaborate fermentation or bottling process. The concepts are streamlined to make the game playable and--hopefully--fun.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah we could have had this game instead!

https://www.etsy.com/listing/88247481/how-to-make-wine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alright, that makes some sense. Thanks for the thoughtful answer. It's not immediately intuitive, but now I have an idea of where you were coming from.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When teaching the game, I tell people the crush action puts the wine in barrels whereas the make wine action bottles the wine, allowing aging to happen in both situations. A fudge, but helps with theme.

There'll be a new print of Viticulture, but not a Kickstarter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...why would they go back to Kickstarter?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rasmus: I'm glad you're interested in our games! We run Kickstarter to create things for the first time, but after they're created (and we gauge interest in them), we use traditional and distribution.

So for Viticulture and Tuscany, we work with a company called Morning Players in Europe to get our games in the hands of European retailers. Viticulture is tough to get because it's pretty much sold out, but some distributors and retailers may have it--your local store needs to request it (perhaps directly from Morning Players). There's definitely still copies of Tuscany still left in distribution.

We're working on a new print run for Viticulture. We'll reprint parts of Tuscany in the future, but probably not the whole thing. If you want everything, now is the time to get it.

Viticulture puts players in the role of a small winemaker in old-world Tuscany. Players build up their vineyard by planting fields, harvesting grapes, building new structures and filling wine orders. In Viticulture, the components, artwork, and mechanics combine to create a artistic and thematic game about the wine-making business.

Components / Set-Up

When you pick up Viticulture, you may be surprised by the weight. There are a lot of beautiful components and cards that come with this game. There are 118 cards with 42 wine cards, 36 wine order cards, 20 summer visitor cards, and 20 winter visitor cards.

The game board and vineyard mats are double-sided, one side has all the labels while the other is unlabeled. Players can choose to have a more visually appealing experience without the labels, by flipping over the game board.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wooden tokens are amazing. There are 30 worker meeples in the 6 different player colors and one Grande Worker for each player. There is also 1 gray temporary worker. There are 6 Rooster or wake-up tokens, 6 cork victory point tokens, 6 wine bottle residual payment tracker tokens, 48 wooden structure tokens (trellis, windmill, irrigation, yoke, tasting room, cellars, cottage), and 1 grape first player token.

There are also 72 lira money tokens in 1, 2, and 5 denominations.

To set up the game, give each player a vineyard board and place the game board in the center of the table. Give each player one pinot vine cards and their wooden tokens. Each player starts with a crush pad, a small cellar, three fields, 3 dollars in coins, 1 random summer visitor card, 2 regular workers and their Grande Worker.

Place each deck in the marked space on the board. Players should place their cork victory point token on the start space on the victory point track and their wine bottle token, the residual payment token, on the middle of the Residual Payment Tracker. Next, players decide where to put their rooster wake-up token on the wake-up chart. Going first allows you to act first but gives no extra bonus. Each other space of the chart offers players an advantage such as an extra card or the temporary worker. The later you go in turn order, the better the advantage. Decide who gets to place first, that person is the first player and takes the first player token.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Object and Goal of the Game

Players start out with a small vineyard and a few workers. With the help of different visitors, smart planning, and new structures they will plant, harvest and turn grapes into fine wine. Completed wine orders and the occasional visitor card will give the player victory points, the goal is to earn 20 victory points. When this happens, the year will be played to end. Players can then earn up to 25 victory points, and the player with the most victory points wins the game.

Game Play Overview

Depending on the season players will complete different actions. Summer and Winter are the only time that players will place workers. Once placed a worker is not available for the rest of the year; a worker placed in summer is not available in the winter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spring

During the spring, players will select the order in which they will “wake-up” on the turn order track. If they chose a space with a reward, they immediately collect that reward. For example, if they choose the third space they draw one wine order card, the fifth space allows a player to draw either a winter or summer visitor card, and the 7th and last space awards the temporary worker.

Summer

During the summer, players can expand their vineyard, plant vines, give tours, and sell grapes. In turn order, players place their workers on the yellow summer spaces on the board, and immediately take the action. Remember a placed worker is not available for the rest of the year. Players may place their workers on the same action on subsequent turns, as long as space is available. When they place a worker, the player must take the action. They cannot place a worker on the sell grapes space if they don’t have grapes to sell. After players can no longer place workers, or have passed, players start the next season.

The Grande Worker follows the same rules as the regular workers but have the unique ability. They may be placed on an action that is already full.

The game can be scaled based on the number of players. In a two-player game, only the left action space is available. For 3-4 players the left and middle action spaces are available and for 5-6 players all spaces are available. Players can claim the spaces in any order.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summer Actions

Play One Summer Visitor Card: Choosing this space allows a player to play one summer visitor card from their hand. The bonus space allows an additional summer visitor card to be played. A player can only play the card if they can fully resolve the effect. For example, the Wine Critic requires the player to discard two wine tokens from their medium or large cellar to receive three victory points. They must be able to discard two wine tokens to play this card.

Sell Grapes: When players choose this space they must sell at least one grape token. The lire gained is shown by the coin between the crush pads, sold grape tokens are discarded. The bonus allows the player to gain one victory point.

Plant Vines: When players choose this space they may plant a vine on one of their fields. The field may be empty, or you can stack on top of already placed vines, the value of the grapes may not exceed six per field. Once planted the vines stay on the field, wine makers don’t uproot their vines after harvest. Players may remove a field only if they use a visitor card or they build the yoke. The bonus allows the player to plant an additional field.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Draw One Vine Card: When players choose this action they draw one vine card. There are nine different types of grapes and they have different values. Each grape is either red or white except for pinot, which is both. Some grape may require a trellis or irrigation to be planted. If players choose the bonus space here they may draw and additional card.

Give a Vineyard Tour: This space allows a player to collect 2 lire and the bonus space allows the player to collect one extra lire.

Gain 1 Lira – This space may be used in the summer or winter and any number of workers may be placed here. When placed here the worker earns one lira.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build Structures: When choosing this space, players can build one structure. Each structure has a different cost. Once the cost is paid take the token and place it on the correct space of the player mat. The bonus allows the player to build at a 1 lira discount.

Trellis – this structure costs 2 lire and allows players to plant certain types of vines.

Windmill – this structure costs 5 lire and once built it allows a player to collect 1 victory point, per year, when they plant a vine.

Irrigation – this costs 3 lire and is required to plant certain types of vines.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tasting Room – this costs 6 lire, and once built it gives a player 1 victory point for every tour of their vineyard.

Medium & Large Cellars – Players start with small cellars that only let them store up to 3 value wines. When they buy a medium cellar for 4 lire they can store wine values 4-6 and create blush wines. A large cellar, with a cost of 6 lire, lets players store up to 9 value wines and create sparkling wines.

Yoke – this costs 2 and allows a player a space they may use once a year to uproot 1 vine card or harvest 1 field.

Cottage – this costs 4 and allows the player to take one extra visitor card during fall

Fall

During the fall players, in turn order, choose to take either a winter or summer visitor card. When players have built the cottage, they can take one extra visitor card.

Winter

Winter is similar to the summer. In turn order players place any remaining workers on the blue winter spaces. They immediately take the action of the chosen space.

Draw One Wine Order Card – When choosing this action, players simply draw one wine order card. The bonus space allows the player to draw one additional card.

Harvest One Field – This action allows players to add grape tokens to the crush pad based on the fields yield. The bonus allows the player to harvest an additional field.

Spend 4 Lire to Train a New Worker – This action lets a player gain one new worker by paying 4 lire. The bonus gives a 1 lire discount.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Play One Winter Visitor Card – This action allows a player to play one visitor card from their hand. If they choose the bonus space, the player may play one additional card.

Make Up to Two Wine Tokens – This action allows players to turn grape tokens into wine tokens. When a player makes more than one wine token, they may be of the same or different types of wine. Players take one grape token and over to the corresponding space in the cellar. For example they move a two white grape to the two white wine space. Blush wines are created by combing 1 white token and one red grape token to make a wine equal to the combined values of the grapes. Sparkling Wines are created by combining two red grape tokens with 1 white grape token. The bonus on this space allows the player to make one additional token.

Fill One Wine Order – this action allows players to fulfill one wine order and gain victory points. They will also move their wine bottle on the residual payment track. Players will gain lire at the end of the year based on their place on the track. The bonus here gives one victory point to the player.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Year End / Game End

After all players have placed all the workers, they proceed to the year-end actions. During the year-end players return workers to their vineyard mat, collect residual payments, take back their rooster tokens, and rotate the first player token counter-clockwise. They will also age their grape and wine tokens by moving them one space to the right. If they do not have a medium or large cellar they may not move the tokens into these spaces. If any player has reached 20 points on the victory track, the game ends. If there is a tie the first tiebreaker is goes to the player with the most lire, the second goes to the player with the highest total value of wine in the cellar and the third goes to the player with the highest total value of grapes on the crush pad.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My Thoughts

Worker placement games were were among the first hobby games I played, and many still rank among my favorites. The theme, components, artwork, and openness of Viticulture have made it a top contender as my favorite in this category. I look forward to what the Tuscany Expansion and wonder if it will help Viticulture outrank the others.

Components

I love all the thoughtfulness that went into the components of Viticulture, everything is beautiful, colorful and good quality. I love the double-sided game boards and player board that allow players focus on the artwork once they are familiar with the game. I’m not sure I will ever use this option since I tend to forget what certain spaces do or provide, but I like that it is available. The board is beautiful, a lot of thought went into the layout and the subtle transition from spring to winter.

The cards are small but good quality. The small size is necessary so the grape cards can fit on the player boards and the game board. One thing I dislike about the cards is that they are all sponsored by someone. I know this is a Kickstarter game and understand why this was added. It is definitely a nice way to show thanks and support to your backers. I found it a little jarring when the game is so focused on the artwork to see this on the cards. I will admit that I hardly noticed it after a few minutes of play due to the small writing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The component I wasn’t sure about but have come to see the beauty of are the wine tokens. They are small, clear glass beads and are just the right size to fit on the player mat. Because they are clear, you can easily see the number underneath. It isn’t necessary to see the number, but I like that you can. The money tokens are okay, they are good quality card stock, but nothing special. They are also sponsored. The box is good quality, has a linen finish, and a useful insert to store the game. It is a small, but an unusual size compared to standard board game boxes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I adore the art of Viticulture, its plain but muted colors add to the aesthetics of the game and remind me of paintings of the Italian countryside. The artwork on the cards is well done and the graphic design is appealing. The writing is small and may be hard to read for some players. The color choice for the player tokens also adds to the artistic appeal of Viticulture. They stand out from each other and are easy to see on the board.

Rule book / Player Aides

The rule book is only 12 pages long, in full color, and easy to read. It explains everything in detail and uses creative graphics to help you understand. There aren’t that many pictures and no pictures of game set-up, this is usually a problem. But, everything is labeled on the board, so the rule book gets a pass. I like the way the rule book has purple ribbons on the pictures to highlight important areas. After reading the rules, we didn’t need to consult the rule book during the game. The are also large and comprehensive player aides that come with the game. I used this only at the beginning of the game as we read the rules together. I didn’t need it after a few rounds of game play.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Game Play

I enjoy the theme of Viticulture, it works well for a worker placement game because of all the different tasks in the wine making process. Using the four seasons adds to the theme and shows the passage of time. It’s a natural timer people are familiar with and it helps bring the game together. It also helps the round structure makes sense, you give wine tours and sell grapes in the summer, train workers over the winter, and age your grapes as the years pass. You can take certain actions only during certain times of the year. Another plus is that it makes the game manageable for new players, allowing them to focus on one season at a time.

This passage of time also adds to the calming, open feel of the game. The only timer of the game is the score track. There are no set number of rounds and I don’t feel rushed when I play the game. I enjoy being able to explore the game and try different strategies to win. There are no adverse events in Viticulture, nothing that can destroy your plan if you don’t prepare for it. Viticulture is not a punishing game and thus allows you to be creative in your choices. You still need to be the most efficient to win the game, but how you get there is your choice. Threats don’t force you into a particular strategy. Things like famine or drought could have easily been added to the game but I think they would have detracted from it.

The game seems balanced, allowing for different strategies and paths to victory. There is luck from the card draws, but that is all. For example, in one game my husband was able to quickly build a lot of structures for very little money due to the visitor cards. I, on the other hand, drew cards that wouldn’t help me until later in the game. I got behind early but was able catch up later in the game, even if he did end up winning. In another game he gained a lot of victory points from visitor cards while I only earned them from filling orders.

The Grande Worker is a great addition that also adds to that calm feeling of the game. Being able to place the Grande Worker on an already occupied space keeps you from being shut out of an action you need. It also adds the meaningful decisions of when to use your worker. You may need to perform two actions, and both are full. Where do you use the Grande Worker? Even if you are blocked in another area, every area can get you something useful. Even with all of decisions to make I don’t believe there will be a lot of analysis paralysis moments in Viticulture because there is always something useful on the board to choose.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Visitor cards are one of my favorite parts of the game. You quickly see their importance. Visitor cards help introduce flexibility, and a bit of complexity into the game. They also introduce different ways to score points. I especially like that they allow you to spend victory points to gain advantages. Usually in a worker placement game going into the negative is bad, and its very hard to recover. This isn’t the case in Viticulture, you can take the short term sacrifice for a long-term gain. Loosing victory points isn’t a punishment and can be very helpful.

Some of the visitor cards are more useful at the beginning or end of the game and getting these at the wrong time can set you back. The can also be helpful at the game end. Your opponents won’t know what cards you have and you may use a visitor card to score victory points at the very end to move ahead of the other players.

Overall

I have heard a lot of positive praise for Viticulture and was afraid of being disappointed. I wasn’t disappointed and that praise is well deserved. I loved Viticulture and it is it quickly becoming one of my favorite worker placement games. The wine making theme works well for a Eurogame, and the art, mechanics, and cards work together to create a well-balanced game. There are many paths to victory which adds to re-playability, and you aren’t forced into a particular strategy.

I really enjoy the build up of the vineyard and the aging process of the wines. The games scales well with multiple players counts, but the variable turn order doesn’t have as much impact on a two player game. The game is also a good length, but the end if bittersweet. I feel it ends too soon, you have finally built up your vineyard and then the game ends. I want to keep going to see how much more I could produce. Since it plays in about 40 minutes you can play multiple games in one night.

Viticulture is a beautiful game and as with wine, it gets better with time. I look forward future games of Viticulture and the Tuscany expansion.

Thanks for reading and the praise Andy! I always look forward to hearing from you!

Thanks for sharing this well-written and beautifully photographed review! One quick note at the end--while Viticulture can play in about 45 minutes for 2 players who know what they're doing, I want to make sure that people know that more players add a lot more time (the game can go up to 2 hours after everyone knows how to play). Your blog is focused on 2 players, so I understand why you posted 30-45 minutes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you like the base game this much, I think you'll really like what some of the modules from Tuscany add. All I've added so far are the new board and the new visitor cards, and for me they've bumped Viticulture from a pretty-good-but-not-great game into one of my all-time favorites.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great review! This is the type of game I was looking for in a wine themed game. I kickstarted it and was VERY pleased with the development and the final product. Vinhos was immediately traded away.
Jamey makes great games and board gaming aids and I never have a problem investing in his endeavors.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks you so much for the praise. I actually made a mistake with the timing, I think that was for a different game so I will fix that, even if our two player games are quick. We added a few of the expansions this weekend and really enjoyed what they added to the game. I like the Mama's and Papa's for the different starting resources and the new visitor cards. There is a lot more in that box so we have many many more games to play.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nice review, love the close-up shots of the meeples. I need to stop reading reviews like these, because they make me want to go out and spend my money on yet another game!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I liked just about everything about this game when I played it, but I had a real problem understanding how the beads work with the harvesting and aging and turning into wine. I read the rules twice and just was not able to internalize how it was supposed to work.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris: The beads are grapes. When you harvest a vine, you pluck grapes from the vine and move them to your crush pad. When you turn those grapes into wine, those same beads become wine tokens in your cellar.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm doubting between Viticulture and Vinhos. Why did you immediately trade Vinhos away?

Hilo ID 1401036:
I want to like this game, I truly do, but I absolutely hate games that limit progress. I played the card that allowed me to increase a wine age by 2 and fill an order. Well the only wine I had was already 9. Because of this I lost the game. Can wine not be aged beyond 9?

Also, why am I limited to 5 lira at the end of each season from the wine orders I filled? It's an artificial restraint and held me back mid game. If I'm continually selling more wine wouldn't I be making more and more each year?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How could this have possibly lost you the game? There's no order cards that require more than a 9 wine anyway.

I'm not sure I am on the same page as you with games that "limit progress". I can't think of a single resource management game that will just let you do whatever you want. They're all either limited by components or by design.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you're up to 5 income by mid-game then you're a much better player than I am! I've never found this limit to be much of an issue in play.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you're up to 5 income by mid-game then you're a much better player than I am! I've never found this limit to be much of an issue in play.[/q]

All this.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It sounds like you're frustrated.

You can see "rules" as limiting progress, or you can house-rule them, or you can decide that the rules are the framework of the game and learn how to play within that framework.

Suggesting you "hate" Viticulture because you lost a game sound like you play games to win.

And the 5 lira thing? As others have said, you're taking waaay too long to finish the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@OP: on this point, how many turns does a game last you? £5 is a high residual income to be "mid-game" you should be pretty close to the end by the time you've delivered that much wine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think we played that card that you could play it on a wine which was bumping against the top of your cellar and use it to fill the order anyway. We may have been wrong about that - it's not quite the same situation described in the rules (IIRC) about not being able to take an action you can't fulfil. It's not like trying to plant vines you don't have; you have a wine, you can increase its age - it's just that doing so doesn't actually change anything, just as it doesn't when you try to age it at the end of the year beyond the top of the cellar. So wine can be aged beyond 9, but doing so doesn't actually change the wine token's position. I may be wrong about how we handled that situation, though, so I'll defer to Jamey when he swings by!

Once you get up to £5 residuals you would usually be no more than a turn from finishing the game anyway. And even if you're not, it's usually the case in Viticulture IME that by the time you have that much income, you rarely if ever have a way to usefully spend it, because in the later rounds grow/harvest/make/sell is far more important than 'spend mony on buildings or workers' - unless you've got one of the visitors that allows you to pay money for points, trying to spend the money you're earning in later rounds is likely to cost you actions you desperately need elsewhere, because the stuff you spend money on, doesn't get you more than one point per round, whereas growing, making, and selling gets you a lot more... So in practice, you could probably houserule away the residual limit and it wouldn't make a whole lot of difference.

Don't forget this game is a race; if you're going slowly enough in later rounds that you're concerned about bumping against the top of the residual track or the top of the 9-cellar, it's not unlikely that you're going too slowly and someone will beat you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have a problem understanding your problem.

I find this card,

Master Vintner: Increase the value of 1 wine token by +2 and fill 1 {Wine Order}

and I interpret that as a chance for a freebie upgrade, which a player just ignores if not applicable yet still gets to fuflill an order.

Maybe a player would mistakenly hold back the card with the belief that the increment was required, then losing the game for failing to make the sale. But you said you played the card. How did making the sale make you lose the game? Or why would you play it if it would make you lose the game?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The answer is that by the confines of the rules about storage in the Wine Cellars, no it cannot be aged beyond 9.

But as already pointed out, the Wine Order cards are coordinated with this limit such that they never require more than 9. I see no reason to feel harmed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the back of the Viticulture rulebook, don't have Tuscany so I don't know if there is a revision that makes resolving effects on a card optional.

Visitor card - You may only play a visitor card if you are able to fully resolve the effect on the card...... Multiple actions on visitor cards may be taken in any order.

As noted that card has two effects to resolve. Increase a wine by +2 and fulfill an order. But if necessary you could fulfill an order first, which may then allow you to increase a wine by +2 (filling that new open slot).

Also see this post from
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While I agree with your assessment I also refer to the back of the Viticulture rulebook:

"Note 2: Players do not lose wine or grape tokens if they cannot age them. For example, if a player owns a medium and a large cellar and has a red wine tokens value at 8 and 9 when it comes time to age these tokens, they remain in the same position" Because of this statement I think that this card can be used on a grape on location 9 to keep it on location 9 since it increases and then stays where it is.

The only argument I can see someone making is that the card tells you to increase the wine by 2 and not age it by 2 years (otherwise Note 2 would come into effect) but I don't buy that this was Jamey's intention (though he can come here and correct me).

However, if we treat the "increase" as different from an "age" then while it doesn't change the solution here it should actually allow you to increase a grape from 3 to 5 before you build a medium cellar which yet again I don't think is the intention.

Edit: So i also checked the rules summary sheet and in the end of year it says "If a token cannot increase in value.....it does not increase". The action increases a wine token by 2. Just because the wine token is started as 9 and ended as 9 does not mean the the token did not get increased by 2 it just means that you increased the token by 2 and it remained as 9.

I guess the other interpretation leads to some more weird cases. Like for example you have a wine token on values 2, 4, 6, 8 (all red) does that mean that this card is unplayable? I would argue its fine because you can increase the 2 to a 4 and then by the stacking rule it becomes a 3. However people seem to be saying that this is wrong because it failed to increase a wine token by 2.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rami and David: Both of you are correct in this instance. I think David's right in that the best way to use the card in this circumstance is to increase the value of a wine token by +2 and then fill a wine order with another wine token (or the same one).

But you can also increase the value of a wine token and just not have it move anywhere (if it can't move anywhere due to cellar limitations), as in the case that Rami describes. Ideally you would avoid doing that to optimize a card, but it's possible.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would agree. I can't interpret any intent on the part of this game as being meant to harm players for having high wine values.

(though we still don't know how this fits with the original complaint.)

edit:
though I see resolution from the designer appeared while I was composing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By differentiating between age (where it sits on the cellar track) and value as you are, you are allowing me to forgo building any future cellars as long as I keep track of a wine's value. By the above logic, a wine could start the turn on the 3 age space but at the end of the year could have a value of 4 and remain on the 3 age spot. Next year it could have a value of 5 etc.... and still not move.

But the paragraph on AGE GRAPE AND WINE TOKENS is in conflict with your statement and my conclusion above because it makes a direct correlation between location (the age) and value as it specifies that token values increase by movement along the track and values cannot have a value higher than 9 (also the highest "age" on the track).

In addition your Note 1 states Wine tokens can only be aged past the value of 3 if the medium cellar has been built and past 6 if the large cellar has been built (my emphasis)

By the Note aging and value numbers go hand in hand.

With all due respect to you as the developer of this game which I enjoy, I see your statement as quoted and the rules as written being in conflict on this issue.

my two
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David: I think you're misreading my above post a little bit. I'm not saying that a 9-value wine token can become an 11-value wine token. I'm saying that you can use an ability that ages a token without actually increasing the value (if the cellar space doesn't allow you to).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I know it's a little counterintuitive, but it's just a matter of the rules not getting in the way of you playing a visitor card like this, because to play a visitor card, you must actually do all the things on the card.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can agree with that because that happens at the end of the year (written in the rules) but that's not what you wrote above, which I quoted and based my "conclusion" to.

But the card in question doesn't "age" the token it instead specifically "increases" the value. If the only wine token is a 9 value wine, can the Master Vitner be played? (I believe that was the OP's lament) Can that 9 value be increased to 11 to satisfy the first condition. Per your quote above, I gleam the answer to whether or not the card can be played is "no" ? unless of course one can ignore resolving all effects of a card.

Sorry if I am being argumentative. I sometimes like playing the 's advocate.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry, I use the words "age" and "increase value" interchangeably. When tokens age in Viticulture, that means they're increasing in value--it's the same thing.

So yeah, as the designer of the game, I'm saying that a player can play the Master Vintner on their one wine token if it's a 9-value token. The token does not increase to a value of 11; it simply doesn't move.

The rules in Viticulture aren't meant to get in the way of what makes common sense. The common sense answer here is that the player can play the Master Vintner in this situation.

This is opposed to, for example, the Queen card. The Queen says that you must give each opponent 1 card from your hand. Thus if you don't have enough cards to give each opponent a card, you can't play the Queen. It's meant to avoid a loophole where a player may play the Queen when they have no cards in hand and still gain the benefit.

Make sense? If the rules are worded confusingly or vaguely, that's my fault. But the glory of BGG is that I can come here and clarify them. This is my clarification.

Would a 2-Player game be unbalanced if the Grande Worker placed on a location first would collect the bonus action? If the Grande Worker went to a location already occupied there would be no bonus. Has anyone tried this?

For some reason I thought that was how it worked but looking through the rules and forums that is obviously not the case.

Appreciate any feedback! Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That was actually how it worked in the original edition if you had the Arboriculture expansion, which back then contained the Grande. In those rules the grande worked as you describe.

In the second edition the grande whas then moved from Arboriculture to the base game and had the bonus action ability removed, and the ability was given to one of the special workers in Tuscany.

I think I played the two player game with this rule and that it worked fine, but I'm not 100% sure, since I've tried out several different variations of both multiplayer and solo Viticulture, and I could be mixing things up. I Know that did try it out while I made the solo version for Tuscany, and in my not so objective opinion it worked fine there. It didn't make the cut to the final version, though (we wanted to avoid confusing the player by having different grande rules in solo and multiplayer, particularly since the grande rules had changed previously), and instead we gave the player a bonus action token each turn, that he could spend whenever he wanted when placing a worker to perform a bonus action. The solo mode is played on the 2-player action spaces and the bonus action token rule was generally well-received by the playtesters.

Hello,

I know that in tuscany you can do a winter action, in wich you can convert wines into vitory points. I can do it at home with pen and paper, but it would be nicer if i can get the Tuscany graphic for the conversion. Maybe the game is going to get unbalanced with one more spot to go on winter, but i can make it an end of the game only thing. Or maybe attach it to another action space?

On the other hand, there is the market on Tuscany which allows you to convert diferent goods. Also can make it with a house rule, but it would be nicer if y could get the print and play action space with graphics and all.

I would actualy pay to have those spots in a prettier graphic for my viticulture. Well i actualy own Tuscany, but haven't tried it yet. Maybe y could scan the graphics on the board, but i'll better have the PnP.

Please consider my request, and thanks in advance! Cheers!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antonia: I understand what you're saying, but those actions were reserved for Tuscany instead of adding them to the Viticulture board for a variety of reasons. I would suggest that you simply obtain Tuscany and use the extended board if you want to use those actions.

Hi,

I have searched the forums and read the FAQ and I can't seem to find the answer to this question, but sorry if it has already been answered.

I know when harvesting grapes, you add together the value of grapes of the same colour in the same field (ie: if a single field has a 2-white grape, a 1-red grape, and a 1-white grape......you end up with a 3-white grape and a 1-red grape on your crush-pad).

Now, I understand that if you do not have the room on your crush-pad you can select a lower-value slot (ie: the 3-white space is already taken so you can use either the 2-white or 1-white space if it's available).

However, my question is, when making wine, does the same rules apply? In otherwords, I have a 3-white grape token, but if the 3-white space in my cellar is filled, can I create a lower valued wine........can I create a 2-white wine or a 1-white wine instead in my cellar if the spaces are available?

Thanks,

Hugh
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely! But definitely try to avoid doing it.

If I need to make a 9 sparkling wine and I have a 1 red, 2 red, and 9 white, can I use those for a value of 12 to make a 9 sparkling wine?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely - you add up the values of the 3 grapes involved, then place a new wine bottle in the corresponding space on your cellar. If it isn't available (because it's already filled, or because it doesn't exist, as is the case with a 12-value wine) you just use the next available one, in decreasing value order. So you'd put a wine token in the 9 space; if it was occupied it would go in the 8 space, and so on.

edit: 'd
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, you can if you have the large cellar structure.

Edit:

My first time
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you're talking about grapes that are 1 red, 1 white and 9 white, then yes you can turn them into a 12 sparkling wine. If you mean wines you've previously made on the other hand, then no, they can't be turned into other wines. I assume you mean the former, but just being clear.

Sneaky moves to a new location!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You all are awesome, thanks! Now, back to my vineyard....
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you all for helping Tony!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A sorta follow up, if I only have a 1 value Red grape and a 1 value white grape, I cannot combine those to make a 4 value blush wine? To make a blush, I male a 4 value blush, I have to have a combined red and white grape total of 4 (assuming the 4 value blush is available).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right, normal math is required. 1 + 1 = 2, and the minimum blush value is 4. So until your red and white grapes can add up to 4 (and until you have a medium cellar), you can't make blush wine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have a similar question. I am assuming the numbers must add up exactly to the wine you make. For example, if I needed a 4 blush, I cannot combine a 2 white and a red 3... unless a 5 blush was already taken. Correct? This makes it hard to fulfill orders. If you let your grapes age too long, it is difficult to make the blends.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, add up to exact.

Remember, you don't need the exact value of wine to fulfill your order. Ex: you can fulfill a 4 blush wine order with a 6 or even 9 blush wine. So, you would never "need a 4 blush". You will just "need a 4 blush or better".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John,

You do add up the individual numbers on the grape tokens to arrive at the final wine number. But you can also use a wine of higher value to fill an order. For example if you have an order for a 4 blush, you could use that 5 blush to fulfill the order.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That is the rule I was missing. I scoured the role book after my post and found it. Thanks for the response!

The biggest thing is the new grande workers that the 2nd edition comes with. There are a few other minor changes, but there is absolutely no reason to get the 1st edition. In fact, try and get the Tuscany expansion as soon as you can, as well. It is well worth it.

Are you up for a challenge? If so, read on . I’ve spent some time recently creating special solitaire challenges for Tuscany together with
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
and I hope that a lot of you will join in. The idea of the challenges is to make small tweaks to the rules that force you to try out new strategies so that the game will be more varied.

In this post I’ll post the first challenge and encourage you all to post your score to this thread, so that you can compete on who can get the highest score.

I have no clue whether there’s interest in this kind of thing, so this is an experiment. If it turns out that there’s interest, then I’ll publish the other ones over time.

With that out of the way let’s get started.

When playing this challenge use the following expansion modules from Tuscany
Automa
Mamas & Papas
New visitors
Advanced visitors
Properties
Extended board
Structures

Replace the old visitor cards as described on the bottom of page 7 of the Tuscany rulebook and remove cards that only give you a benefit if other players take an action (or simply discard and draw a new one when you draw one of them).

For today’s challenge play with the following rule changes:
Before setting up choose any two structures from the structure deck and build them for free.
You don’t get the 1 VP per structure for building these two structures.

Let us know how many points you score and what structures you chose.

Hi,

I'm interested in these but only have the Viticulture base game so will have to sit this one out.

Hilo ID 1387702:
So, I just got Viticulture and Tuscany, and while I've been really enjoying my sessions with them, I'm a little torn on how I feel about the slight unbalance of the visitor cards.

Granted, I'll preface this by saying I'm someone who prefers very little random elements or chance in games, and I've accepted that drawing cards will always include that. But I feel that as long as the cards are relatively equal (just require a different strategy) then that's fine.

But seeing a Visitor card that gives two Lira and a visitor card that gives three Lira, I just don't see why these are both included. One is objectively better than the other, with no downside. Is it a huge difference? No. But, when a player gets a direct, concrete advantage just because of the card they drew, that strikes me the wrong way.

An example of two cards I think do this very well are the one that lets you pay 2 Lira for a worker your next turn and the one that lets you pay 3 Lira for a worker now. Each has an advantage and disadvantage over the other.

I dunno, maybe it isn't that big of a deal. But I still don't see the justification for it, besides for adding just random luck.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, I would call it a failing of my earlier design self. I don't think it ruins the game, but it does give you an odd feeling if the card you play is nearly identical but slightly worse than one that someone else plays. If you have Tuscany, you can replace those cards with more balanced and versatile visitor cards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One option for you then would be to go through the deck(s) and remove the card(s) that you feel are "unfair." I really like the new cards in Tuscany since they seem to solve one problem the base game had... getting a more-favorable-to-use-in-the-early-part-of-the-game card in the later stages of the game, and vice-versa. Stick with it (at least that is my suggestion).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We just opened the advanced visitors, and replaced the old cards under the advanced variant for our next game, so that's good to hear. Tier 1 fully unlocked!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We also play with the Advanced, New and Arboriculture bonus Visitors. It's a lot better than the base game, but still prone to the odd Winter Visitor bonus delivery card that tips the balance of the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh yeah, that's another thing. In the same game, the same person got two Winter cards that let her fulfill an order for a bonus. She got to 25 before anyone else could even hit 13
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You have to have the Wine to do it, but it certainly happens (most games I play the winner "gets lucky" with at least on Winter Visitor delivery bonus - to the point where people buy Cottage and go hunting for them and hoard them, it's like Elder Sign camping in Arkham Horror )

I'm seeing lots of favorable reviews about Viticulture and its expansion, and I love worker placement games.

But, I lived in the center of wine culture for many years and - for a variety of reasons that I'm sure many years of therapy and pharmaceuticals will fix - I hate that world and that lifestyle. (If you like wine culture, I still like you - I just have personal problems, that's all.)

So, with that said, are there any of you out there that also aren't into wine that have tried playing Viticulture? Is it good enough of a game that you still like the game and want to keep playing it despite the theme?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.

I know nothing about wine.

I don't even drink alcohol.

Viticulture + Tuscany is excellent.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Same here. Hate wine love this game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You do not even have to make wine during the game. You can simply sell grapes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shrug. I rarely drink, and when I do it's almost never wine. But I do really enjoy this game.

I think unless it's a theme you really object to, it shouldn't impact your enjoyment of the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I never really got into wine of any kind. To this day I can't stand red wine, but as I've gotten older I find I like the occasional Riesling or Asti. It didn't help that I married into a family of wine snobs.

Even after all that, I think it's a great game that I really like playing and should introduce my in-laws to someday.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No likey wine... really likey Worker Placement ... really really likey Viticulture / Tuscany!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I really, really like wine. I think I have a vague inkling of what you mean by "wine culture" and I'm pretty sure that there's none of that in the game - though I haven't added any of the tier 2 expansions from Tuscany yet. Buy it, it's a really good worker placement game (one of a very small number that I'm prepared to play), the theme is there - but in the best way that a Euro can do it rather than in the best of the Ameritrash style
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A curious transformation of the usual generic query around here, "Does theme matter?"


(it reallly doesn't ... except that I still refuse to play Space Monster Zombie Dungeons.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why not choose another game?

There are many "Euros" that are good to excellent
Why not play those with no wine theme?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agreed, it would be like someone who doesn't like Romantic Comedies asking if they should watch a particular Romantic Comedy because of the strength of the acting.

There are SO many hundreds of excellent games out there, go for ones with themes you really dig!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I really enjoyed the game and don't like wine. But I also don't hate wine and the industry. There are other worker placement games that are just as good, so why play a theme you hate? If you hate the industry a lot, I probably wouldn't buy a copy. It would be nice if you have a game club or friends that have a copy of the game where you could try a play.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks everyone, for the thoughtful responses. Based on all the feedback, I was leaning away from getting the game, and thought the best way to keep myself from buying it would to be to show a video review of it to my wife, since she has the same general opinion about wine as I do. Her thoughts would remove any lingering sense from my mind that I should be spending money on this.

Well, she got about two minutes into the review video and turned to me and said, "I LOVE the theme!"

So much for that strategy. I just finished placing my order.

There's a lesson in here somewhere...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I played this game recently (it was pretty fun, despite my general confusion) but as a person who plays 95% wargames I had to comment on this strange thread. I hate war and I daresay most wargamers do too. I will say there has always been a vague guilt about playing games on the subject. But if hating war prevented our playing games that end of the hobby would evaporate overnight. If you hate wine and wine culture it easy enough to find another theme. I would prefer to turn this game into a new form of beer pong!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I started eating grapes and drinking wine more often after playing this game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I rarely drink wine (Would be great if they made a Gin/tonic making game)but this is such a good game with an interesting worker placement mechanic that you want to play it. So you can really enjoy this game and Tuscany as well regardless if you like or dislike wine and the best thing is you don't even have to make wine if you don't want to so many options for victory.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Women are fickle? *raises shields*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think it is more appropriate to ask: can you love wine and wine-making and still enjoy this game? The theme is so poorly realised that all I could think about when playing it was what nonsense. Ageing grapes, tour guides visiting pre-modern Tuscany, harvesting in winter, making blush wine (which is only made in the US), combining red and white grapes to make blush wine...none of it makes any thematic sense.

Viticulture is set to arrive on my doorstep this Friday and I am quite excited for it to hit the table. After watching reviews on Tuscany, it is only a matter of time before I purchase it. Nevertheless, I want to enjoy Viticulture for quite some time before expanding to Tuscany. How much mileage did you get out of Viticulture before you made the jump to Tuscany? For those that haven't gotten the expansion but still play Viticulture frequently, what has prevented you from getting Tuscany.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For my wife and I, we played five games of Viticulture before we started on Tuscany. The problem was that I had bought both at the same time and I was pushing to add different modules to the game. It's easier to do so when you already have it... However, if I did not own Tuscany yet, I think we probably would have gotten in five more games or so before buying Tuscany. Viticulture holds up on its own completely, but adding Tuscany improves the game greatly in my mind.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ryan, you can get a lot of mileage out of the base game. When playing with more than 2, I've found that adding in some of the extra visitor cards from Tuscany was nice, and besides that, we've been trying to slowly add one thing at a time. If you enjoy exploring different strategies on your own, you'll have a blast with Viticulture. If you prefer a little bit of prompting for what strategy to take, then the beginning expansion modules of Tuscany will really shine for you by introducing secret goals and asymmetrical starts. I'd say play several games of Viticulture first before researching Tuscany more, you'll have a clearer idea of whether it's something you'll want then (you probably will want it, cause it's awesome ).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Viticulture + Tuscany is a good game for two players? It remains valid?It runs well? Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Definitely. I think it's better with more than 2, but it still works well and is a lot of fun with two!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I mostly play 2 players game with my wife, and it is one of our favourite in that configuration.

The extended board also have some bonus spots that you can use in 2 players games witch give more tension to the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But how does the "table of rising" playing in two? Using only the top two spots or everyone is free to choose any place, and then the bonus?
I also wanted to know how to use the expansions of Tuscany, the used all together? Add only some modules? Which ones work best?
Thank you.

In other words, can you rely on buildings and visitor cards to gain more VPs rather than building the medium cellar?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's definitely possible. In one game I only completed one order and did quite well (I don't remember if I won). You definitely don't need to build the large cellar since there are some orders and blue cards that will get you points from medium aged wine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If it's a more than two player game, you can potential get a victory point on the wakeup chart, in the middle "fufill an order" spot (not very crowded early game), on the "sell grapes" spot (not very crowded late game), by giving tours (if you built the visitor's center), and by planting vines (if you built the windmill). There are also some great summer visitor cards that give you points for uprooting vines (which you don't care too much about with that strategy).

It's pretty fun to try at least once, especially if you start with a windmill from you Mama+Papa cards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sounds interesting, though selling grapes for gold may not be a good deal...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I came very close once without ever filling an order. You need to get the right cards and hit all the spots others are not taking that get you points every round instead of the big windfalls.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1267313/victory-6-years-23-p...

Also, you often don't need to plant much to fill wine orders:

http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1294624/one-pinot-vine-strat...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maybe...but it's the type of thing you'd want to do because everything worked out that way. I wouldn't ever go in with that as a plan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was finally beaten two weeks ago by a friend who EVERY TURN put his rooster on the one victory point slot, bought the tasting room and gave a tour every single turn. He filled a couple orders, but that was secondary to picking up two points every round.

I realized too late that I needed to begin blocking him from those spots.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We had a 6-player game, and a friend of ours did that his first time playing. Never planted any vines, and won by 15 points. Not sure I'll even play the game anymore without a house rule that states you must have wine to use the tasting room ability.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's interesting, because in the (I don't know exactly how many) times I have played
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
with new players, I have never had anyone not plant vines during their first play. It just seems like the thing to do, since the game is designed around that feature (even though of course you don't have to).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What were the other players doing? When winning by 15 points the others were stuck around or below 10 points.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are you sure they used the tasting room right? You can only get 1 vp per year with the tasting room. Even if you take "Give a tour" multiple times you can only get a single VP.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He gave a tour every year except the first for a victory point. He also choose the Wake Up Chart selection that gives you a victory point (Tuscany board), which, in hindsight, we should have blocked him out of, not that it would have mattered. He also concentrated on gaining summer & winter visitor cards, and played several of those. He also used the Trade Action (Tuscany board), and would trade lyra or cards every turn for a victory point. So, he always made 2 or 3 points a turn, and a few more if he got the right cards. He could have flipped all of his fields on the first or second turn, and beat us even faster, using the Trade Action space more often. He also Trained a new worker a couple times. That's all the actions he did.

The rest of us played traditionally, and never had a remote chance of catching him. In fact, only one player fulfilled a wine order before the game was done. It was fast. Maybe 7 years tops. Some of the other players scored a few points at the end with the Influence Action board, but he skunked us hard.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, he was very careful to do that. Good point.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've seen run away victories and been on the winning end before but only once in our 20+ plays has somebody won with the small point strategy and only by a few points. We were all kicking ourselves as we would do little to stop it as we were all angling for a big final turn and he ended it 1 round early.

With the Tuscany board people really under use the sell a wine spot to turn a blush for 2 or sparkling for 4 points. I don't how the small point game can keep up with somebody making those wines and just selling them. Also its really good to combo with all the little point spots to add some power to that strategy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Playing traditionally, given 7 years, many of the players I play with have no trouble exceeding 30 points on a regular basis. His play exposed inefficiencies in your traditional play.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was thinking much the same thing. 7 years sounds like a fairly average number for players familiar with the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perhaps so. I think he still would have beaten us soundly, even if we were drawing really good wine orders. By the 2nd year, he was way ahead. By the 4th, he was way too far ahead to catch. Most of the rest of us had quite a bit of wine in our cellars by then. Just wish we were drinking it instead.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Someone doing the victory point grabs will always jump out ahead in the first couple years. This usually narrows signficiantly as other people get wine production engines going. I've seen people win by starting with this strategy, but only by tossing in a wine order or two late game (usually simple ones, not something that requires a lot of aged wine).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These sentences do not add up. If he was only 15 points ahead at the end, then I'm not sure how he was uncatchable on turn 4 of 7. You said that the other players had a lot of wine in your cellars. The right order cards should be able to convert a lot of wine into a lot of points. After 7 rounds most of the players should have been in at least the 20-30 point range. What were your final scores?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How many points did he have on the 2nd year? Is 6 points on the 2nd year what you meant by way ahead?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't remember the final scores, but I did an analysis of what he did and how many points he was guaranteed doing so. If we had blocked him half the time from choosing Wake Up #6 and the Trade 1/1 Action, he would only have made 22 points by year 7, which isn't very much. We didn't, but when someone chooses this strategy, we may from now on. Without any of us blocking, he would be guaranteed 26 by Year 6. (31 by Year 7)

However, he cycled a lot of visitor cards through his hands, since he wasn't planting, harvesting, or making wine. Several of those he turned in for multiple points. That won't always be the case, of course.

So after crunching the numbers, it seems, to me, to be a valid strategy, but it may not be a broken one. We'll be on the lookout for anyone trying it again though.

Really nice to see there's a lot of people out there who like this game as much as I do.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh, and he also built the Cottage. Like I said, he cycled a lot of Visitor cards, and since you can use them in the Trade 1/1 action, he did that as well. I think if I were using this strategy, I would Flip Properties early, Train a Worker at least once, and alternate between Wake Up positions 5 and 6.

Of course, we teased him mercilessly about having a Tasting Room with no wines to taste.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have a friend in your group that routinely tries to win without make wine at all, doing the tasting room + card combos strategy. Picking points here and there. We call it the 'opportunist' strategy.
He wins quite often and likes to say the game is broken because he can win that way… two other friends agree with him.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then use the rules in the new edition. You have to have a wine to use the tasting room (it's not consumed but you have to have on wine in your cellar).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1377120:
After reading these boards I bought both Viticulture and the Tuscany expansion, read (and reread) the rules and persuaded 4 other members of the Spirit Wednesday night gaming group to play.

1.) I replaced the basic visitor cards with the "advanced" visitor cards from Tuscany. I'm really, really glad I did because the basic card timing issue would have been a killer in this particular game.(Right)

2.) Playing with 5 players for a first game was big mistake. I'd lit on the "3 or 5 players for a more forgiving game" (due to the number of spaces available), but with the linear scaling with the number of players this made for a much longer game than we would have liked. 30-40 minutes per player is not unreasonable for a first game, but that scaled to 2-3 hours with that many players. We should have limited ourselves to a maximum of 4 players as I will do in future unless we get a group composed entirely of experienced players. (Wrong)

3.) To vary the set-up and relieve the starting game "crush" I used the Mammas and Papas setup cards and for the most part that worked really well. In the base set-up everyone starts with a Pinot grape that means all have access to both red and white wines. With the Mamas and Papas though you don't, which resulted in 1 player never managing to get any white vine cards (bad luck with multiple draws) whilst, of course, every order card he picked up was for white wine. I'm tempted next time to give each player a Pinot vine in addition to the Mamas and Papas cards to prevent this happening (at 1/1 Red/White this shouldn't seriously imbalance the game?) or perhaps have a number of Pinot available as one-off trades (thinking about it I like this latter option). So (Right/Wrong)

Overall 4 of us liked the game. I'm not sure the 5th hated the game with quite the level of venom his comments suggested, but he definitely got hit by some of the misfortunes of "wrong vines/wrong orders" hence the starting variant suggested above.

Finally, and it's probably a national thing, but this was by far the most innuendo laden game we've played in some time, mainly centred around the Spring and Fall actions.

I'd be interested if other British groups have noticed the same or it's just our twisted sense of humour?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I blame Jennifer Ham for this, but it's the placement of our cocks that triggers the puerile comments. (Total player age &GT 200)

Definitely agree on the Advanced Visitor addition and I'm intending to add Mamas and Papas next game (which will be my fifth)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Mamas and Papas are great ways to mix it up and try different strategies based on what buildings you start with!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I did, you know. I hated it every bit as much as my comments suggested. Often it seems like I really hate a game that in reality rates a 6 or 7 out of 10. This game, I'd cheerfully give a 5. Maybe a 4. But I'd much rather give it a score of 4 or 5 miserably, rather than cheerfully.

I saw 5 purple vine cards before drawing a single white vine. And saw 4 order cards all game, absolutely every one of them requiring more white/rose than I was *ever* going to be able to produce. Perhaps my luck with the other visitor cards wasn't quite as bad as I suggested (though I got the shitty end of the stick several times), but the bad luck with vines & contracts meant that I was shafted. In a 45-minute game of fun, that's fine; in a 2.5 hour long ball-crusher, it sucked. Perhaps I could have wasted more actions drawing more cards, but the two or three times I tried it I just got more purple vines and more white orders - and I wasn't exactly replete with options OR workers, having both the fewest workers, the least cash and mostly last in turn order for too much of the game.

Lesson - going first has MUCH greater advantages than the odd coin or card offered for going later in turn order; in hindsight, this is sodding obvious, because going first allows you to score a +1 card/£/thing advantage in BOTH spring and autumn. But when the first choice marker moves the wrong way around the table it's possible to find yourself welded to last place several turns in a row, so you miss out on the bonuses AND miss out on the actions you want to perform.

Ultimately the game had far too few decisions for my liking. Excusable if it had taken 60 minutes. Inexcusable for something way over the two-hour mark. Gags about waving cocks around were not enough to save the experience. Ultimately there are other, better worker placement games that do the whole "tight actions, tight economy" thing far better. Though, FWIW, I think the "lucky/unlucky card draw" problem can sometimes spoil Agricola, and it's much, much less of a problem there than it was here.

I have Vinhos unplayed. I'd heard that was a very good game about wine-making, albeit more complex than Viticulture. I just hope that it isn't anything like as bad. Still, after being blocked from playing the wonderful Quartermaster General I did at least manage three things last night; two good games of Roll For The Galaxy (I swear I'm getting worse at it), and one opportunity to not feel remotely unhappy about not buying a new game. Learning that I really dislike a game always comes with the silver lining that I won't feel any desire to buy the game to add it to an already too-large collection.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And I think your comment about 4 out of the 5 players liking the game might not be right, either.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The issue with repeated bad card draws is virtually eliminated by the large board expansion because it adds trading cards in as an action. That's practically speaking the "real" game, with the original board practically an introductory version to the basic concepts.

When you consider that the most common criticism of the full game is that it's too easy to win without making any wine at all, it becomes clearer that card draw doesn't factor into it all that much.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our first game of Viticulture had five players who had never played before and was done in maybe 1.75 hours. If you're taking more than seven game years to finish then you're not playing correctly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's an inaccurate conclusion! The last game I played was won by someone who only made 2 wines - and he won by a country mile. He played very well, capitalising on some awesome draws of Visitor Cards (he had all six workers at the start of his third year). So IMO card draw is really important, but more important is being good at using the cards you draw in an effective way. I suspect that it takes more than just a couple of plays to hit that level of skill. Maybe at that point card draws could be said to matter less.

Personally I have no problem with there being multiple paths to victory- it's the mark of a good game IMO. Certainly I have no issue with a "no wine" route: the game is about running the most profitable vineyard, not about making the most prestigious wine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm going to take a wild punt here that Richard won't be up for another game next Wednesday...

The other players said they would play again at least!

We all have our preferences - I don't like "rubbish" games like Quartermaster General, Flashpoint and Pathfinder .

One thing I forgot to mention, that on reflection probably had more impact than was immediately obvious, was that we were NOT using the "Friendly Variant" rule regarding the bonus spaces. I'm pretty sure that the game was greatly extended as a result since I know I was blocked on multiple occasions by the bonus' being taken by people who hadn't used them and had to adjust my turn as a result.

The game length was mostly due to people having to rethink their worker placement in light of others moves - 7 "years" sounds about right for the number of turns (although I wasn't counting).

The conversation did get me looking at the other Tuscany modules, so next week we'll be using all the tier 1's and at least the expanded board. This will open the trader (alleviating the lack of red/white vine issues).

Glad to hear we weren't the only ones making crude jokes involving cockerels and cottages.

Finally I have a suspicion that this may be another game that is somewhat "group specific" in that some groups will take longer to play depending on their "style". I'd say our group was more than averagely competitive - so people tended to actively seek to hinder their opponents rather than solely concentrate on improving their own position. That lengthened the game considerably as plans had to be constantly revised during turns.

Thanks for all the replies folks. They gave me quite a bit to think about.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm not seeing how anything you wrote does anything but reinforce my conclusion at least wrt wine orders, but I guess if you want to say that visitor card draw is certainly still critical, I wouldn't really disagree there.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of them confided in me afterwards that they had lied when they said that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
See, I told you that you have no taste.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is this "we" business, Paleface?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The expanded board makes it a WAY BETTER game, and the Structures expansion on top of that makes it even better still. The structures give a large variety of possible strategies, many of which don't require making wine at all. And, as mentioned above, the new board gives you the option to trade, which is huge. There are many more actions, too.

The Tuscany board really does make it into a whole new game.

I'll also agree to the comment about 5 or 6 player games taking way too long. Our first game with six (including two experienced players) still pushed three hours, which is way too long for a game like this. It gets better over time, but it's still surprising up front.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've only played once, and we played a 5 player game of Tuscany (with all of Tier 1 and 2 I think). It took 2 hours which seemed to surprise the other players, all of whom had played before.

It does seem like Tuscany is Viticulture 1.5; there's a lot more replacing of things than is usual for an expansion. There's one person in our group who wants to learn vanilla Viticulture; I might try it out of curiosity but it does seem like Tuscany is a better game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First of all a disclaimer: I got involved with Stonemaier Games while the Kickstarter for Viticulture was running and I designed the solo expansion that’s included in Tuscany, but one of the reasons I got involved was that I thought that Viticulture was a very good game.

Also, it’s important for me to say that I ‘m not writing this because you should like the game, but it seems to me that you’ve fallen into a trap that I’ve seen multiple people fall into regarding Viticulture and that’s killing your chance of enjoying the game.

Let's take a step back here: What's the game about? It's about running a vineyard. Given that, what would you think that you should be doing to win? Exactly: You should make and sell lots of wine. It's very easy to subconsciously go with this line of reasoning based on the theme (I did so myself initially), the problem is that it leads you to think that the winning strategy of the game focuses on fulfilling lots of wine orders.

Why is this a problem you may ask? It's a problem because the game has multiple viable strategies and by overlooking this you turn a great game of adaptable strategies into an exercise in frustration. I view Viticulture as a game where you have to adapt to what the others do, what your position is in the start order, and what cards you draw, and if you don’t do this you’ll either get crushed by those who play adaptively or get frustrated if everybody uses the same strategy as you do and you’re the one that draws the worst cards for that strategy.

Instead of having one fixed strategy you need to adapt your strategy to the circumstances of the current game you’re playing and this includes the cards you’re dealt. So, instead of thinking “this card doesn’t fit my strategy”, you must ask yourself “what should my strategy be so that I can benefit from this card?” That’s not to say you can’t draw cards that won’t be useful in any given game, that will happen, but it’ll happen a lot less if you’re having an adaptable strategy.

Similarly thinking that you must fulfill lots of wine orders will lead you to think that it’s a big advantage to go first, which is not true if you an adaptable strategy.

In the multiplayer games I’ve played (mainly first edition, though) the alternate strategies of not going first and not aiming to fulfill a ton of wine orders have won more often than not. That is scoring VPs from the wake-up chart, tasting room, visitor cards, and the sell grapes bonus.

So, my point is that I think that a lot of the criticism leveled at this game is based on a single misconception of the game. It’s not a game with a fixed long term strategy of fulfilling lots of wine orders. Instead, it’s a game of adaptable strategies.

That’s not to say that the game has no faults or that everybody will like the game. If for example you prefer building fixed long term strategies and trying to execute and perfect them, then you definitely won’t appreciate Viticulture as I do, and I’m not criticizing your preference. Preferring fixed or adaptable strategies is subjective, and my preference is not better than yours, but consider your perception of the game: Do you perceive the game to have multiple viable strategies that you need to use adaptively or are you approaching the game from the point of view that it’s vital to fulfill a lot of wine orders? If you fall in the latter category (as I did initially), then I ask you to consider the game from an adaptable-strategy-with-multiple-paths-to-victory-perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excellent and insightful analysis with which I could not agree more! When I teach the game I point out that there are 4 VPs available in Summer, every Summer. It takes only 20 VP to win.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erm, where are they? I could see only the "sell grapes" space, which I did once (to gain *one* of my five VPs). The other three VPs have passed me by. There's the winter "sell wine" space, but if you're able to make red wine but only have orders for white, you're SOL anyway.

Sorry, I'm really not feeling any love for this game at all. When there are games like
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
and even
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(although it can drag if players dick about with their moves too much), I'm going to reach for a game that I *know* I and others enjoy rather than chasing my tail playing a game I didn't get on with the first time. I certainly detected nothing in Viticulture that would make me want to play it *ahead* of those other games - it didn't seem to me to be offering anything new in the SP genre whatsoever.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sell Grape, Tasting Table/Tour, Windmill/Plant Vine, Wake up #5.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can see there's a matter of "taste" here: I haven't played Snowdonia, I enjoy Alien Frontiers, but not as much as Viticulture and I wouldn't play Agricola if you paid me - it's a terrible game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you include the point on the wake-up track and possible points for having the windmill ($5) and tasting room ($6), you could get 4, but those don't seem particularly reliable or easy to get into. Perhaps if you've gotten the visitors that let you buy buildings for cheaper?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, they don't just fall into your lap - but then neither does delivering a wine order. My point was that if you are totally focused on delivering wine then you will be missing these opportunities to generate points outside of that strategy. The great thing is that if everyone else is focused on deliveries, you'll have an opportunity to clean up on these ways to generate VP and possibly only need one well-timed delivery to win with. Even if multiple people are going down the Summer VP route you ought to be able to score at least two points in any given turn via this route.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tasting table and windmill were so far out of my reach they never occurred to me; I started with a cottage but almost no cash, and the early vines I drew all needed the irrigation (and in two cases, the trellis) to even plant. Hence I was cash-strapped and way behind the curve for the first half of the game at least. So I was never in any position to buy the windmill, nor the tasting table, and it took a sodding age before I had everything in place to pick my first grapes.

No "multiple routes to victory" ever opened up for me (which was one of my HUGE complaints about the game); having been dealt a harsh hand at the start (and yes, perhaps not knowing the game well enough to find any way to break out of it; but escape routes were FRA from obvious to me even with 20/20 hindsight) I just took the obvious moves - when they were left to me - and accepted the kicking. But as I'm no masochist, I didn't enjoy it.

The King of WP games remains Snowdonia, by a country mile (especially when that mile is in Wales and all uphill).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's funny because I had an experience with Snowdonia like you had with Viticulture, and so have no desire to play it again. Fortunately there is no lack of worker placement games.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So you spent all your money on a Cottage (or chose one with Papa Kozi). Now you are complaining that random draws didn't give you a cash engine and you'd priced yourself out of making wine. This is not a valid complaint. If you had as much as £1 (you said you were almost out of cash, so I'm presuming you did) you could have built Irrigation and planted a vine in Year 2 unless you were blocked out of money on both the wake-up track and the Tour and if three players also built before you and if none of the four to six Visitors you'd drawn could give you money by Year 2 Summer. That isn't impossible, but it's a heck of a lot of "ands".

I think you made a poor play decision through inexperience. Really your group shouldn't have used the Mamas and Papas without having played out the normal balanced setup at least once to see how everything interacts. But don't blame the game for it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We shouldn't have played with the Mamas and Papas. Not my game, not my choice.

We shouldn't have played with five players. Not my game, not my choice.

We shouldn't have played learning straight from the rulebook. Not my game, not my choice.

What is my choice is to play something different next time.

If a game allows a new player to plough it right at the very start of the game, there's something wrong; something that many games choose to fix in the rulebook if nothing else (take Roll For The Galaxy - it specifically FORBIDS a new player from taking a suicidal move during setup). FWIW, most of us (who had the option) took the building at the start; the player that didn't won by a country mile. Some advice in the rulebook - "take the cash, dammit!" might have helped here. As it was, it quickly became a *completely* one-sided game; my bad luck (or bad decisions, if you'd rather) just meant that I came 5th instead of 2nd, 3rd or 4th; but for 4 of us, coming 1st never seemed likely after the end of the first turn or two. Probably all down to those blasted starting Mamas and Papas.

And FWIW, I've won plenty of games on my first game, and hated them. And lost plenty f games (often due to poor decisions), and loved them. It all depends on what experience the game delivers. Vituculture's experience was "no different to every other WP game, but with plenty of luck and the ability to have that luck - or maybe decisions taken in ignorance - completely plough the game for you". I can live without something that is at best no better than plenty of others and arguably a whole lot worse. I look forward to watching Andy round up those other three players for a game this week; I'm going to be trying to play something else.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Me too! For me, Viticulture falls into the second camp. Never won, never come close, still enjoying it though. Funny thing about my game playing: I definitely enjoy winning games; I rarely win at the games I like. In fact the more I like a game, the less likely I am to win. I just can't figure it out. :shrug:

One of the biggest criticisms levied against the game is the amount of swingy luck present in the card draw, particularly the visitor cards. Has anyone implemented any house rules to help mitigate this luck, such as:

1. When drawing any cards (or just the visitor ones), draw two (or three) per card normally drawn and keep one (or however many originally allowed). Immediately shuffle in the discarded card(s).

2. Lay out a small row of cards for each deck Ticket to Ride style and have players draw from the row or blindly when drawing cards. This would offer the most strategic options but may slow the game down a bit I suppose.

Thoughts?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The advanced visitors from the Tuscany expansion basically fix this. I would look into making a crib-sheet of the advanced versions and referencing it when playing the originals.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Does such sheet exist? It seems like that would really slow the game down by having to reference a sheet for every card drawn. It's a shame that the designers fixed the card in an expensive expansion rather than just reprinting the base game with the fixed cards. Or at least offering a cheap card fix expansion with just the visitor cards for like $10.

I played my first game with the wife and I liked. I am not a wine guy but I liked the satisfying process of creating my vineyard from almost nothing (paid for with those friendly tour groups!). More importantly, the wife liked. She is a wine person but she's only a medium game person so games are hit or miss with her, this one hit. She also liked building her little world and the rules were't too brain burner for her.

So it's a lovely little game, but now do I have to buy Tuscany? I read that it's an awesome expansion. So I guess I'm kinda answering my own question (not that there was a whole lot of question there). But if you want to tell me more reasons why I should, I won't mind.

Kudos to the designer / publisher; this is a winner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you do not want to buy the Tuscany Expansion, do NOT watch the Dice Tower review/overview of it. Watching it will cause you to break speed records pressing the buy button On your computer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The nice thing about Tuscany is that there are quite a few small modules that you can incorporate... one at a time. They add new and very interesting options, without being overly complex. There are some that add decent complexity, but there are also several smaller ones that won't bog your wife down. At this point, especially with the new board, I don't think I could ever go back to playing vanilla Viticulture, even though I really enjoyed it the first many plays before I got the expansion.

Just a quick post to give props to Stonemaier Games. I received Viticulture as a Mother's Day gift, and the purple medium cellar was broken. I went to the website, requested a replacement, and had a new medium cellar within a week. Very impressive! And the game is awesome as well. They do good work over at Stonemaier. I'm a fan.

Yes, this company has not only an excellent customer service, but also sports the most reliable and best Kickstarter campaigns of them all. By far.

Agreed, excellent service. I had a couple of miscut visitor cards. Replacements arrived within a week.

Hey all, couple quick rule q's.


1.) In a two player game are the extra actions (i.e., bonuses) for each worker placement spot unavailable?

2.) When harvesting grapes from a field are the values combined or each one considered a separate grape? For example, if I have a Cabernet Sauvignon card (red value 4) and a Pinot card (red value 1, white value 1) in a field and then choose harvest, do I put down three separate tokens (tokens on red value 4 & 1, and white value 1) or two tokens which represent the combined value (one on red value 5 and one on white value 1).

sorry if this seems dumb?!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Yes.
2) combine like colors (so in your example you get a 5 and a 1)

Viticulture has become a favorite for me and my girlfriend, Kelly. We love how streamlined and positive everything feels. There are no negative event cards, you never lose crops to pestilence or disease, the theme is fantastic, and an excuse to drink a glass of wine is never unwelcome . We also both really enjoy worker placement games. Are you noticing a trend here? Last but not least are the components.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
has become known for their awesome wooden pieces, and I'd be lying if I said that the farmer meeples and windmills didn't add to the fun and immersion. Oh yeah, there are those metal coins too!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At this point, I've hopefully been able to convey how much the two of us enjoy Viticulture, so without further ado, here's the story of how I got engaged playing Viticulture.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We'd played Viticulture with both 2 and 4 players a handful of times before, and had mentioned how awesome the game was to a couple that we occasionally played games with. Well, tonight was the night, tonight we were going to introduce this couple to the wonderful world of Viticulture! My girlfriend and I were both excited about this, although I was even more excited for another reason, I had two special things in my jacket pocket: a ring and a Viticulture card.

I should mention at this point that the weather had consisted of cool spring days for about the last week. Today, however, was an exception. I had emerged from my basement office earlier that day to find that it was actually quite warm out, definitely too warm for a jacket. I, however, elected to stubbornly continue wearing my jacket. My girlfriend knew that I must have been uncomfortably hot, but I stuck to my guns so that it wouldn't arouse suspicion when I insisted on taking it with me to game night that evening.

Where was I? Ah yes, my jacket pocket. Let's talk about that Viticulture card. In Viticulture, there are visitor cards which you draw throughout the game. Each card displays the title of the visitor (such as a "Tourist" or "Businessman"), a picture of the visitor (modeled after backers of the original Viticulture Kickstarter), and a list of special actions you can take when you play the card. Earlier that week, while my girlfriend was in a late night class, I scanned in one of the winter visitor cards, changed the heading to say "Fiancé," and photoshopped in a picture of the two us. As for the special action for playing that card, it now read, "Get engaged. You and your fiancé both get 1 victory point." Now fortunately, our Viticulture cards are sleeved, so I was able to print out the new card front and slip it into the sleeve of one of the game cards such that it looked like all the other blue winter visitor cards in the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Armed with my new card and ring, we continued on to game night. In all conversations we had in the car, I made sure to maintain the facade I had been honing for the last couple weeks. As far as Kelly knew, due to work deadlines, I had not even begun to look for a ring, and I probably wouldn't even have time to do so until June. It was starting to be difficult not to crack a smile whenever the subject came up.

We got to our friend's house, set up the game and got ready to play. I strategically positioned myself so that I'd be the closest to the stack of blue cards. To my horror however, Kelly sat down in the seat I had staked out, right in front of the blue cards, in the very chair with my jacket slung over the back containing precious cargo!

"Oh, I was going to sit there and be the banker. Did you want to be the banker?" I asked.

"Oh, good idea, you can be the banker," Kelly replied.

Whew, that was a close call! We explained the rules to our friends and started the game. I had conversed briefly with the couple we were playing with earlier in the day, working out a plan where we would take a break halfway through the game so that I could slip my card on top of the deck. Since she'd played before, I knew that about halfway through the game Kelly would transition from drawing yellow summer visitor cards to blue winter visitor cards, in fact, I was counting on it.

"Do you guys want to take a quick break?" our friend asked. Uh, oh, it's too early! Kelly might still draw a yellow card instead of a blue one!

"I'm okay to keep playing a bit more," I cut in.

"Yeah, that's fine with me," says Kelly.

Another close call. That one was my fault, I realized that I had never explained exactly how long it would take to transition to the "blue card" phase of the game.

A bit later we got to our break. While Kelly was distracted by a dog, I slipped my card on top of the blue deck. She didn't notice, mission accomplished! Now all she had to do was draw the card. We continued playing. Kelly ended up first in the player order for the next year, meaning that she would go first for winter actions after we all drew cards.

"Okay, time to draw cards."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The other three of us hemmed and hawed about what color card to draw. The pause seemed to stretch on and on, but unaware, my girlfriend reached over and picked up the top blue card. Success again! Now I just had to wait.

"What? Wait, what? Are you serious?" Kelly stammered.

Surprise I was expecting, confusion, not so much.

"Do you want to play your blue card?!?" I asked excitedly.

She played it. The rest you can surmise. I got down on one knee and took out the ring. In the excitement I actually forgot to ask her to marry me, but she thought she missed the question, and said yes anyways!

We never actually finished the game (technically, Kelly was in the lead, so she says she won), but it was still my favorite game of Viticulture to date and we plan on keeping the new card in the game!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edits: Made pictures bigger
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's awesome, big congratulations to the both of you.

(good thing you weren't in the lead with 19 points though, she might have engaged herself to someone else at the table to not give you the extra victory point )
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark: This is one of the best things I've ever read about Viticulture. I like how carefully you planned it out--making the card, sleeving it, timing it for the point in the game when people start to draw more winter visitor cards. Brilliant from start to finish, and a big congratulations to you and Kelly!

If there's room on a card sheet in a future printing of either Viticulture or Tuscany, I'd like to add your Fiance card to the game. I'll get in touch with you if we're able to do that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is great, congratulations to both of you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congrats to Mark! and Jamey, this is what makes your company one of the top publishers in the gaming world. not only do you encourage these types of "mods" but the fact that you want to add the card in is just awesome. Congrats to everyone!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is such a great story! An a great offer from Jamey, too.

I think the Fiance card should specify that the engaged couple must pool their assets and agree to the name of the dog, though.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This just makes my heart swell Congratulations to both of you!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This story is everything I love about boardgaming.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quick, Jamey! Get ahead of them and make 'Mama and Papa' versions of them so they can announce any future babies with Tuscany.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outstanding! Congratulations. What I liked most about the story is the subtext of respect you and your fiancée have for one another (in the rhythm of your communication) and the fact that she played the card immediately.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congratulations! Apparently the theme of this years wedding season should be Viticulture.

My wife and I got married April 18th and Viticulture was one of the games we brought with us on our honeymoon. We ended up stopping at a winery on our way home and played a game over a bottle, I couldn't have asked for a better ending.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've been on BGG for a long time and that's definitely one of my favorite stories ever. Congrats to both of you!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jack: That's a clever idea! It would fit well with the Mamas and Papas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DH: I'm glad you two enjoy the 2-player version of Viticulture. Playing at a vineyard does indeed sound like a great way to end a honeymoon. Thanks for sharing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mazel tov! What a cool story.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I love this story!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the kind words everyone! And Jamey, my fiancée and I would be honored to be included in a future printing of Viticulture!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very, very cool. Thanks so much for posting this and may you have blessed wedding and marriage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congratulations you two! This was a great story!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fantastic! Congratulations!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congratulations! Thank you for this great and romantic story around this great game! :-)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congratulations to you both. What a delightful story to read. Well done
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the story is drawn to its conclusion, I'll go ahead and post the final card:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is unbearably sweet. Congratulations!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I hadn't even realised the actual date of the OP. Why it showed up in my web browser, I don't know - unless I clicked on a link by mistake. But, what a wonderful story and conclusion! Is this card part of the Moor Visitors expansion?

Edit: I can see from the image of Moor Visitors that it is indeed included

Another Edit: I have since found out from where I clicked the link. It was on the Moor Visitors Pre-Order Launch Notification e-mail.

Therefore David Studley and I have worked with a group of playtesters to make solo play work with just the base game (including a campaign mode). The resulting rules are now available here. It's a draft version and by that I don't mean that I expect the rules to change, but that the document hasn't been proofread yet.

Apart from the rules, you need the base game, and the following link, which has a simple online implementation of the deck of cards that are needed: http://viticulture.noesia.net/Automa.html

Stonemaier Games are on a bit of a roll with me at the moment. A relatively new publisher, but so far they’ve impressed me with their activities. Viticulture was a Kickstarter success, easily making its funding goal and now producing a giant expansion for the game, which I’ll get on to reviewing soon – once I get my copy. Sadly I wasn’t introduced to the game in time for the Kickstarter, but credit where credit’s due, from having participated in the Treasure Chest Kickstarter recently, Stonemaier do a good job of supporting their games and keeping in touch with backers. Euphoria, another of their successful projects, is also a cool and unique game that impressed me more than I expected it to. And I’ve never been so hot in anticipation for a game by the cover alone until Scythe came along…

Thanks to my girlfriend, white wine has been firmly engrossed in my drinking list alongside cider and I’ve developed a particular liking for Sauvignon Blanc. Red will take some more time but it’s getting there. When I looked for a decent game related to this theme however, the list came up woefully short. Farming games in general don’t seem to be plentiful outside of Uwe Rosenberg, but why not? It’s a great theme! Haven’t we got bored yet with selling goods in Europe or building/connecting structures of some kind?

Vinhos seems to be the only major wine contender, but from what I’ve heard, that game is insanely complicated with the client base for who I can teach it to being quite small. Viticulture looks to be a lighter version, attempting to capture the theme of running a vineyard without making the experience too complex or “math-y”. And does it?

# of Players: 2-6

Ages: 13+

Play Time: 90 Minutes

BGG Rank/Rating: 232 / 7.71


Would You Care To Test The Wine Sir?

The mechanics are your standard Worker Placement affair. You have your own player board with areas that you build upgrades on as well as storing your workers and on each round you will place your worker one at a time to perform a special action. Turn order is dictated by a track where players stipulate how early they will get up in the morning. The longer they leave it, the better the bonus, but they risk being last. The piece to represent this is a wooden cockerel which if like most gamers you have the mental age of a child, will provide its own fair share of amusement.

The main board is split into two sections, one for summer and one for winter. Summer begins first and the actions available are restricted to that season such as planting vines, conducting tours for extra cash and building upgrades. These will allow you to plant more grapes, store more wine, gain points for various activities, etc. Players can choose to pass even if they have workers spare because those you don’t use in the Summer are then available for the Winter and you can’t go back and forth.

In the Winter, the actions relate to training new workers, harvesting your vines and producing wine while possibly completing customer orders. Players can also play special visitor cards depending on the season which give a benefit to the player and sometimes others as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When a field is harvested, it produces grapes depending on the vine rating and these will vary in quality and from white to red wines. Grapes can then be converted into wines (white, red, blush or sparkling) again depending on their quality. Creating the latter two requires a mix of different grapes just like in real life.

At the end of the round, players will age their grapes and wines by increasing their rating by one and then collect their annual income which starts at one and increases as more wine orders are fulfilled. Play then continues as before until one person reaches 20+ victory points and triggers the final round.

Quality Wine Can Only Be Made From The Finest Grapes

Stonemaier is setting a good trend for component quality so far. Euphoria had a really colourful board, good linen cards and cool custom dice. Here it’s no different. The money counters are sturdy and if you upgrade them to the metal coins they are downright gorgeous! The player boards are detailed and explain the main rules associated with each action and building. Grapes and wines are represented by these neat little white semi-spherical see-through counters and the cards, despite not being linen finished are still of a good thick card stock so sleeving is not required. You would expect most publishers to simply make generic building tokens or “Monopoly” houses but no, here every building you can make has its own unique wooden piece. That’s attention to detail right there!

Having the extra player boards can require a bit of table space however so be wary when playing with lots of players. Generally though you shouldn’t have an issue fitting this out and the insert has been designed to allow for easy retrieval of components without having to bag or box any of them up.

The boards alone produces a lot of (bad grape pun alert) juicy theme with the colours and artwork, but you really only notice the strength of the theme as you play the game. The actions being separated by season correspond to how vineyards will typically conduct their plans for the year. Summer is easily the best time to grow your vines and when do you ever visit a vineyard in the freezing cold of Winter?

Other little flavours here and there really showcase that some research was done when designing this game from aging wines/grapes each year to adding a tasting room to improve a tour and even the simple premise that harvesting a field doesn’t remove the vine because you only remove the grapes, not the entire root. They sound small, but they all add up to a very thematic experience and I approve of this a lot in Euro games.

It Also Takes Precision and Timing

As you can tell, Viticulture’s worker placement setup is much like other Euro games, but I always like it when the turn order depends on your own strategy rather than being fixed. Maybe I don’t want to go first this round; I’ll have a lie in and get some rest! This is particularly important in games of 3 or more players because placing a worker on a space first in line may convey an additional bonus so you’re in that tense position of hoping you can grab the space first, but that all depends on what else you need to do and what time you woke up!

The tension for spaces can change a great deal between even and odd player counts, much like in Ticket to Ride with the double routes. The number of available spaces changes for example from 2 to 3 players, but not from 3 to 4 and similarly not from 5 to 6. Therefore expect the game to be more cut-throat with 2, 4 or 6 players.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Doing well in this game requires good planning skills too. You ideally want to cover as many different tasks in one round as possible and keep a smooth engine of grapes and wines flowing otherwise you run the risk of stalling. Of course this is a worker placement so this is no easy task, but it really gives the game a lot of strategic depth. This can lead to a bit of a run-away player issue though if someone manages to get a good head-start and continues to perform well.

All that aside, there’s definitely multiple ways to play Viticulture. Do you get cracking making simple wines for small orders or do you build yourself up to satisfy the big customers who want the finest sparkling wine you have? Do you try to earn some extra points with upgrading your windmill for planting vines or adding a tasting room to improve your tours? You’re going to need money, but orders take time to fulfil so do you host a few tours or do you make a living from selling high quality grapes instead? It’s not quite as varied as some Euro games, but for the weight it does enough.

The Best of A Bad Bunch

The box states that Viticulture can be played with 2-6 players and typically most games tack on the higher player count to appeal to more groups. From 2-4 players the game moves at a pretty quick pace with 3 being the more “friendly version” in terms of worker placement tension.

The game can easily overstay its welcome with too many players though. If I’m spending a long time in a Euro game I’m hoping I’m sitting at a Terra Mystica session. With 5-6 players, I feel this game grinds like crazy and that’s without AP players. I recommend never teaching this game to more than 2 new players at a time and keeping your games to 4 players max in general. Otherwise you might alienate players on bad first impressions. I can only envision myself playing Viticulture with 5+ players if everyone knows what they’re doing from the word “go”, but such occasions are almost non-existent for me.

Some rules can be a little fiddly to teach, particularly to new players. Minor examples include passing the first player token anti-clockwise, but playing the cockerels in clockwise order. I know that sounds trivial but trust me you’d be surprised how often people forget that and comment on what the point of it is.

A rather more major rule that’s always fiddly is the tokens for grapes and wines. As you can see they are both grouped into the same definition. The rules for creating grape tokens are fairly easy, but converting to wine tokens always gets a few “huh” moments from non-gamers particularly with blush and sparkling wines that require more grape tokens to make only one wine token. It feels fiddly just trying to write it here. I do think maybe not putting grapes and wines in the same definition would have helped more, but I personally didn’t have a problem understanding it so maybe it’s a new player/non-gamer thing. It certainly helps if the player has an understanding of how wine is made in the first place – which means all those trips around British vineyards have done me some good!

Finally, there has been some comments regarding the visitor cards being a little unbalanced. There is a little truth to this as some cards can seem very powerful compared to others in certain situations and it’s luck of the draw if you pick them out when you want them. It’s not a major swing as you still have to use a worker to play the cards which could be used elsewhere, but you have to accept there is an element of luck involved that may put off some die-hard Euro players.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verdict

Viticulture is a solid medium weight Euro game that should be easy to pick up for gamers, but you may struggle to teach it to non-gamers particularly with the fiddly aspects such as the concept of aging your wine/grapes and creating “tokens”. Take your time and don’t introduce too many people to it at once.

Viticulture was a fairly big surprise for me when I first got round to playing it. I didn’t expect it to pack as much theme as it did in the box, but this is on the same level as Uwe Rosenberg for capturing the essence of what you’re setting out to do – run a vineyard. And it’s Euro games that achieve this that make my collection especially.

It’s been good fun to play despite its small issues and justifies its price point nicely. Try before you buy and keep the player count low, but if the theme of making wine appeals to you, you should certainly look it up. All you need to add is some cheese really…more on that later though, when I get a copy of Tuscany!

You Will Like This Game If:

You enjoy theme in your Euro games – this feels like running a vineyard.

You don’t want a complex Euro game – this is quite straightforward for gamers, but be mindful for non-gamers.

You want a good amount of depth with some variety of paths to victory.

You Will Not Like This Game If:

You might be turned off by the fiddly aspects – have your head switched on

You don’t like the balance issue with the visitor cards

You hate run-away leaders – it’s difficult to catch up if you’re lagging behind.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Like you, I came to this game late and was introduced to it with the Tuscany expansion. I look forward to you review of the expansion as it seems to resolve those things you identify as issues.

Personally, this is ranking as one of my all-time favorite games and probably my absolute favorite worker placement. I love that there is much greater depth than Lords of Waterdeep (a light worker placement I own and enjoy) but that it is not as cut-throat or punishing as Agricola (on the heavy end of the spectrum). Even when the board is tight and you can't take the space you really wanted, it seems like there are always useful alternatives to consider. (But not so many that you can just do anything at all and still be competitive.)

I also love that this game rewards planning ahead. The early game feels like things are moving so slowly as you organize your vineyard but then, almost suddenly, you see the payoff in the late game and accumulate points quickly.

Great game I'm glad I dove into after blowing off some early reviews.

I was interested in trying the pnp now that the Tuscany expansion was available. I downloaded the PNP from the website but no grape or contract cards. Anybody know where I could get these as a download?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To be honest? Just buy the game, it is worth every penny and quality components are part of the experience.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Making a PnP before buying is a good idea. I happened to craft my copy a few weeks before Tuscany was launched on Kickstarter.

Beware that you might also be missing most of the Visitor cards (I only see a pdf containing the updated cards). I believe it must be a mistake in their latest revision of the PnP files, though. I suggest you contact Stonemaier Games directly or simply write Stegmaier here on BGG:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me know if that doesn't work out. I still have most of the PnP cards lying around somewhere.

Thanks Holger. We actually no longer offer a full PnP of Viticulture.

I just opened my new copy of Viticulture, and unfortunately I found a few issues with the cards..

1.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As you can see, the backs aren't all the same color on the yellow cards.

2.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As you can see, some of the edges looked to be nicked up. This was the blue deck.

3.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the purple deck. Not as bad, but still a few things.

The green deck was fine.

Would it be worth it to try and get replacements for these? I don't know how much they woudl affect gameplay and I kinda feel bad since it's 3 of the 4 decks in the base game in the base game. I haven't even opened Tuscany yet.

Thanks.

I've only really played this two players, so I don't know if anything is really lost when you only play with two. That being said, this is currently a favorite for my wife and I to play. Because there are only two players, each spot only gets to be used once (not including the use of the Grande worker). That makes competition tight and planning a necessity, these are two things that makes a good worker placement for me.

Time wise, this game takes us about 30-45 minutes. This doesn't include setup and tear down. When we first played it, it was a little over an hour, but with experience, we have been able to get that time down.

My wife and I play 2-player at least once every few weeks or so. It takes us about 45-60 minutes without the Tuscany expansions. The 2-player games we've played are smooth and easy to learn. I've played with 2,3 and 4 people and I don't think that the 2-player model loses too much when compared to the others. One of the major differences is the use of the bonus spaces on each action. But, given that it's only the two of us, the bosus spaces would only devolve the competition of the game.

All in all, we love it. So much that we decorated our dinning room in a Viticulture theme complete with a framed box cover print.

Kevin: No, 2 different.

Follow up question if anyone looks t this thread again. Two of the three actions to choose from on the Contractor are build one structure and plant one vine card. If I build the windmill then plant a vine card - using my 2 actions from the Contractor - do I gain the 1 victory point benefit from the windmill?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cory: Indeed you do! That's the benefit of choosing the order on visitor cards.

My last two games of this have been epic, with both of my wins being won by money tie breaker. However, I was especially proud of one turn in the last game where I was able to get 12 VP in one year. Unfortunately I didn't document exactly what I played, but I do know I filled two orders, one using a winter visitor with bonus vp, and also got vp early in the turn from the cottage and buying back a field in summer.

I am curious to see what is the most vp you have seen gained in a single year?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the last game I played, I managed 11 points in my final turn.

-2 from a summer visitor that let me trade coins for points
-1 (bonus) from selling a grape
-2 from a winter visitor that let me trade in a wine for points
-6 from filling an order

At the end of the turn I had absolutely nothing left- no cards, no grapes, no wines. It got me the win, though, from 12 to 23 points. The other 2 players ended up around 17-18.

We were using the base board with both sets of extra visitors plus Mamas and Papas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nice!!! Yeah, forgot to mention we were playing with Mamas and Papas and the fields you can buy and sell. If I had had that summer visitor, I might have been able to get one more point in. Yes, like you I ended the game fairly empty handed with no tokens and only 1 card left iirc. But I did have like 17 bucks cash.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just had two game of Viticulture plus some Tuscany exp throw in last Sunday, with 3 other players (4 total). I manage to go from 8 to 24 in the 6th year:

- 3 points from the Wedding Party visitor card by giving out 6 coin
- 11 points from filling out two wine order
- 2 points from a Advanced Winter visitor card by discarding one wine token

We used:
Tier 1 exp - Mama & Papa, Property, Advanced Visitor(replacing most the regular one), Patron
Tier 2 exp - Special workers (Oracle, Soldato)

It's a game with three new/semi-new players. I didn't get block a lot, and I deliberately choose to wake in the "1" spot a few times to make sure that my planned move would work. All of us forgot about the patron, so no competition there.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How about most VP with one worker? I once played the mafia with the no bonus wine order, filling a 6 point order, selling a 4 level cheese, filling another 5 point order (unable to cheese it again by the rules) but had the structure that gave 1VP for each wine order. Crushed it (no pun intended) with 17 VP!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dayummmm... That's a lot you guys! Yeah we haven't added to special workers or cheese stuff yet, so I have no idea how those can affect points. We got sucked into pandemic legacy and haven't continued our viticulture campaign.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I won my last game by scoring 14 points in Year 6. I was able to fill two wine orders for a total of 11, I sold a grape and got 2VP from the Advanced Assessor.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's a solid finish!

Viticulture Automa (the solo mode for Viticulture that's part of Tuscany) was designed to be used with at least one of the Tuscany expansions. Multiple people have expressed their interest in playing it with just the base game though.

Viticulture designer Jamey Stegmaier has now asked me whether we can accomodate those people, so my copilot
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
and I have started looking into ways of doing this.

To support that work it would be awesome if those of you who have played Automa with just the base game could report your results to me either here or by geekmail. That is if you remember how many victory points you got .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I played vanilla viticulture four times with automa.

It was 11,12,15 and 18 points.

It is really hard but much fun.

I have to say that I am not very skilled with viticulture those four plays were the first four times I played viticulture at all.

For tabletop day this year I'm going to be teaching some new players this game in a wine bar. The catch is that I've never played it either.

I have the second edition of the game and have watched the "Watch it Played" how to video twice.

I've got the newest quick reference sheet from BGG printed out so I'm about as ready as I can be on my own.

I'm hoping more experience players can give me some strategy tips that I can share with the new players so they don't feel too lost at the start.

Also, any gotchas I should really watch out for, common mistakes and rules snafus, etc, would be appreciated.

We don't have access to the expansion so it's just the base game. I'm limiting it to four players per game also based on what I've read here.

Thanks for any help! Sorry for the short notice.

I always find it helps to set up the game and play through it yourself (acting as several players) before teaching it.

Yeah the solo play is part of the Tuscany expansion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is totally worth it, IMHO Such a great game. Viticulture/Tuscany is now in my top 5 solo games.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kevin: We actually offer an online simulator for Automa (http://viticulture.noesia.net/Automa.html), but it's really, really hard when you don't use any of the elements of Tuscany.

Also, if you can get Tuscany for $40, that's a steal! It has an MSRP of $70.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perhaps some wine and a game of Viticulture will help with that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The high difficulty can be alleviate by lowering the number of victory points the Automa gets, but to be honest my guess would be that playing without the Mamas & Papas expansion from Tuscany will make the solo game samey after a while.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just wanted to add that the rules for Automa is included in the freely available rulebook for Tuscany, which can found in various languages here: http://stonemaiergames.com/rules-2/

Thus the game can be played solo with just the base game, so you can try before you buy.

If you then like it (but maybe find it samey), then I'd strongly recommend buying Tuscany, since the 10 expansions in there that Automa is compatible with takes the game to a whole new level.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just saw that you've already ordered Tuscany. I'm sorry if you've had a bad experience with Viticulture because of this. If you're unhappy about the purchase, maybe you can still cancel the Tuscany order and try out the base game with the online resources?

And now I'll stop spamming this thread .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I know that kind of internal debate about the "gotta have it all" emotion and the rational part of your brain all too well .

I agree that buying the complete package is a lot of money, I do want to say, though, that for the money you get a big box of 12 expansions with a ton of content, and I think that Jamey did a really good job on the 10 of the expansions I tried as part of my work on Automa. The downside of course is that it's a big leap of faith buying it all in one go, so I think that getting the base game to test whether you like the game is a good approach.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great, I hope you enjoy it .

I recently bought a 1st edition (kickstarter) of Viticulture. The seller kindly included the Arboriculture expansion and also an "Upgrade Kit".

I believe I have understood how to use the various components. (Although the sticker sheet with all the barrel values eluded understanding for a long while.) But I want to confirm the # of workers to use.

With the revised rules, each player starts the game with one Grande worker, and two regular workers. I know I should not use the extra Grande workers that I have, as the Upgrade pack duplicated the Grande workers from the Arboriculture expansion.

But, how many "normal" workers should be available to a player? I have 6 normal workers for each color, as provided in the 1st edition game. We just played, and it felt like there were too many workers. The Arboriculture expansion does say the Grande worker is in addition to the six regular workers. I haven't played that expansion yet, but after our initial game (6 player), I was concerned at the tremendous number of workers in play.

Thanks in advance for any guidance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2nd edition rules, you're limited to 6 total workers, regardless of their type.

Just wanted to let everyone know I've just finished uploading tuckboxes for all the cards in Viticulture. They are sized to accommodate cards that have been sleeved with FFG Red sleeves, which seem a little on the thick side, so you may find the boxes a little roomy if you use thinner sleeves (or really roomy if you don't use sleeves at all!). Their nothing spectacular, but they work, and even fit nicely in the box.

This came up tonight with a new player and it made me wonder if we weren't somehow playing it wrong...

When a player plays a visitor card that has a board action to resolve (for example, one visitor provides you with a bonus when you fill an order), do you have to place a worker on the corresponding action or is the action taken care of based on the use of the card?

Basically, does the visitor card's direction offer a free use of the specific function that a worker would typically provide?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, that's the power of the benefit of using the visitor cards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the answer!

We suspected that was the case and have been playing it that way since D1, but our new guy made a pretty compelling argument... lol
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pete: I replied to your answer on our website before I saw it here. Jim is correct. You can also see the rule about this in the box on page 6 (note 2). Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
not really a free use of a function since one had to put a worker on the play a visitor card action space.

I posted this over in the Collector's edition forum before realizing that this one is probably more active. I recently started making a few different board game accessories. One of the things that a friend and I have been talking about is stands to hold sleeved cards since they tend to fall over easily and go all over the place when they do. Here are a few of the mini card stands I made set up for Viticulture. Coincidently, we are 'uncorking' our first Tuscany expansion as well, Mama's and Papa's!

Conflict between the FAQ and the second edition Viticulture rules with regards to making wine.

In the rules on page 9, the bonus for making wine is referred to as "BONUS: Make 1 extra wine token."

In the FAQ, page 2, it says "if you are on the middle action space, each of those wine tokens has a +1 value"

So which is it?, rulebook says the bonus is to make one more wine token, FAQ says the wine you make is one better than the grapes used.

Not only that, the rules say you make 2 wine tokens. FAQ states you declare 2 wine types, and make as many tokens as you want of that type.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David: That sounds like the first-edition FAQ. Though I'm a little confused by what you mean by "page 2". The FAQ is on our website, which doesn't have pages. Are you referring to a section of the second-edition Viticulture rulebook?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Also, to answer your question, the rules are correct, not the old FAQ.

Looking around at options for buying Viticulture in the UK I'm a bit confused. I see First edition - First edition second printing - Second edition.

Is First edition second printing the same product as second edition?

Also, The Stonemaier site says that second edition has the red stamp indicating grande workers, but some retailers advertise second edition with a picture that shows no stamp.

Finally, since the first edition upgrade kit has glass beads in, does that mean any first edition version won't have glass beads?

Any clarifications gratefully received.

Thanks all
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not sure of the difference between 1st edition 2nd printing and 2nd edition. However, if you see the red seal that means you're getting the updated rules including the grande workers. The glass beads were resized as well to better fit on the board so that's why the upgrade kit has those.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think the First Edition Second Printing is likely to be exactly what it sounds like. It's a reprint of the First Edition (which was a Kickstarter project and came with a bunch of extras, e.g. the Grande worker). FESP might not include the Kickstarter bonuses stuff.

Hi,

Just to be on the safe side:


1)A grand worker can be placed exactly like a normal worker....meaning on the same field, BUT in the case that the action field is full with workers the grand worker is having the special ability to be placed nearby in order to get that action.


2) a grand worker may be placed on the yoke, but only if there's no normal worker already on that place. In other words: the grand worker's special ability is deactivated on the player board.


Correct?

Regards
Mario
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Correct.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thnx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If, in a two-player game a Grande worker is placed in the one spot available for an action and the opponent does not have their Grande worker left, that action is now blocked? The placed Grande worker acts like a normal work in this case blocking the action, correct? (As opposed to being placed just near the action per normal Grande power.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's how we play - if there's a Grande there first, you'd need to use your own Grande to also use the action.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are the bonuses not used in a two-player game?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only the leftmost action spaces are used in a 2-player game, so on the regular board, those spaces don't have bonuses and thus bonuses aren't used.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are you allowed to play the grande worker on a space which you occupy with a normal worker? Can you use a space more than once, using the grande worker?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely! That's the beauty in his role!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excellent, then we played the game correct. Thanks for the quick repl. We are setting up our second game right now
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To be clear, you can place your Grande worker on the same Action as one of your regular workers, but you wouldn't get any bonuses that your regular worker got. You don't actually play the Grande on any particular "space", just in the general Action area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right, there are two ways to use a grande worker:

1. Use it as a regular worker on an action space. All normal rules apply.

2. Use the special grande ability, which is to place it on a full action (put it on the art for that action, as the action spaces are full) to take only the action, not any bonuses on the action spaces.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you place the worker in an action space with a bonus, you get the bonus.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry, but i'm still confussed with the Grande worker. If i play with 2p, the grande worker: 1. Can be placed as any other worker. 2. Does an action that's already been taken by me or by other. But seeing the rahdo runs through viticulture video, it was said that in a two player game, you could also get the bonus if using the grande worker. Then in the coments of the video, someone pointed out that you could only get the bonus if, when you placed el grande, the action space of that action was free. Sooo how does the grande worker works in a two player game?

Thanks in advance!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no bonus in two player game for the Grande worker.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are no bonuses in a 2 player game. So if you use the Grande worker like a normal worker then they are put in the first space (which has no bonus). Otherwise they are used as the Grande worker to take an action that has previously been taken, but don't taken one of the available spaces (as there is only one for each action in a 2 player game). I think that's right at least!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antonia: The Rahdo video is a bit outdated--he's using the first edition. The Watch It Played video about the second edition is more accurate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fcDctkFFE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unless you play with the extended board from the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
expansion which does provide some bonuses in a 2P game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for your replies! It's much more clear now. Cheers!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Does that also mean in the Winter phase on the extended board that if:
I play a regular worker on "fill an order" (in the LH oval);
my opponent plays their Grande on "fill an order";
I pass, and remove my workers;
that my opponent can now place a regular worker on "fill an order"?

This is how we play it, but it would be good to have confirmation we're doing it right.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's correct, Rupert--you're playing it right.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm not sure where you're getting this from. In the rules for end of year it says
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So you shouldn't be removing workers until after everyone has passed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The extended board from Tuscany has modified turn order and passing rules, and this is one of the changes.

(Quote edited for context)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks! I haven't broken out Tuscany yet so I didn't realize there was a change.

Anyone else experiencing "spinning" player boards due to warping?

It's pretty annoying...

Or is there a simple technique to fix it?

The game seems good though... potentially a new level two gateway game...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flip them over to the other side?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When I played it after receiving it, I had no such issue. The normal solution for such issue is to leave the boards out of the box for several days to make their level of moisture the same as the environment where they'll be used. After that you leave them under a pile of heavy books for several days
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Protip: If you stack games horizontally (like I do) and stacked, then make sure boards are stored in the box the other way around as they would be on the table. This may warp them slightly the other way around, but makes sure the components on top of the boards do not make the board warp. Also, never stock boards on top of components, that alone can cause warping in long term.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My player boards warped after we opened the game, but I left the game out on the table for several days because we wanted to get multiple plays in. At the end of maybe 4 days, the boards "settled" back to their normal, flat state. Quite an interesting phenomenon.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mine were warped a little, but I just flipped them over (so they bowed upward instead of down) and set the game board on top of the player boards when I put everything back in the box, and now it's all just fine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you apply the slightest pressure to the middle of the player mat (basically just bend it a little), it will straighten back into place.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
same for me: no such issues
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I also had warping right out of the box. Nothing major yet, I just hope it doesn't get worse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cory: Have you bent the boards back into place? It's not warping--it's just the way the weight was distributed in the box. They bend very easily and stay that way after you do it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I own nearly 300 games and spinning boards are not uncommon, hard to believe with a game collection of your size you've never seen this before. Just bend them back a little, I have to do it all the time to boards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Jamey. I'll try that...I just don't want to bend them and cause a crease. Its really not a big deal at all right now. It's pretty minor really.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is interesting is that I put them back in the box and they were back to normal the next time I pulled them out... Until they started warping again.

It's like they don't like being out of the box.

Frankly this is the worst I have ever seen it. Agricola is fine, Caverna is fine, 7 wonders is fine, imperial settlers is fine... I can go on.

It's just super annoying to play on that side which is the noob side so that's what everyone new will probably want to use.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
strange...as I said: Mine is not warping at all.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That could be because of differences in humidity levels between your environment and where it was produced. The normal recommednation for such an issue is to leave the boards out of the box for several days to make their level of moisture the same as the environment where they'll be used. After that you leave them under a pile of heavy books for several days.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, it's the difference in humidity that's causing the warping.

I live in CT where the winter humidity level can be 50% or much less. When I pulled the boards from the box for the first time last night, the edges and the exposed faces dried (and shrunk) faster than the middle and underside, causing them to warp. I flipped over one of the warping player boards and it flattened itself out after 15 minutes or so. Even the cards that were on top of the decks were warping. I can only assume that the games were manufactured/assembled in a rather humid environment.

When summer comes and the humidity level in CT exceeds 85% for weeks at a time, the boards will curl in the opposite direction. I can tell what time of year it is just by the curvature of my game boards.

I've discovered that useful to cover the boards with a sheet of plexiglass. It keeps them flat and in place while I'm playing, and it also protects from crumbs and spills. Because, y'know, you're supposed to be drinking wine while you play this game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I recently started playing At the Gates of Loyang and after playing the first time I left the game on the table. The next morning the board had warped and one end of the the T-shaped board had lifted itself by about 3 millimeters and the other two ends had also bent upwards a little bit.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I found this much movement in less than a day rather impressive and seeing it made me think of this thread.

I've been eying this game for awhile now but I've also been eying fields of arle.

Most of the time I play games it's with two players so right there arle is probably better. However, I already have Le Havre, Agricola, and Caverna. Should I get FOA? Or should I get Viticulture? If I were to get Viticulture I'd get the Prima version of Tuscany as well (need those metal coins!). Or should I not get either because I have enough agriculture games? Lol

Thanks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It depends on whether you're looking for a lighter or heavier game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
, without the expansions, is about the weight of
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(it gets more complicated with expansions).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
is the weight and complexity of something like
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
, etc. It's a heavy euro. It takes about two hours with two people, and feels like a farming simulation.

To give some comparison, we own both (Viticulture with Tuscany) and Fields of Arle. We played Viticulture once, and were ready to add expansion material. We played Arle once, and felt we'd learned the rules.

Arle doesn't feel similar enough to Caverna, Agricola and Le Havre that you can't own all of them. Viticulture is also excellent fun. You can't go wrong wih either.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for your input! That helps a lot! Have you played either of them solo?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I played the 2-player version of Viticulture (before Tuscany was made) maybe 12 times and had a lot of fun with it. Tuscany adds a ton of variation to the game, so personally I have no problem recommending Viti as a 2-player game. I can't compare it to FoA though, since I haven't tried that.

DISCLAIMER: I'm the guy who designed the solo expansion that's part of Tuscany, so I'm probably not objective , but my 2-player experience with the game is from before I got so heavily involved with Stonemaier Games.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solo Viticulture, using Morten's Automa in the Tuscany expansion, is a fantastic gaming experience. Highly recommended!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We play Viticulture two player all the time and have never been disappointed in it. I have never played FoA but I can't imagine it would be any better two player than Viticulture, different I am sure.

I could see how Viticulture would be better with 3-4 opening up bonuses etc., but I don't think the two player lacks at all.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Late to the party ... I own FoA and played Viticulture (with some of the Tuscany expansion) for my first time last night. I've also played the similarly-themed though heavier Vinhos. No question to me that Viticulture is a hugely fun game that I am now heading out this afternoon to buy from my FLGS, and I've been shrinking my collection for a few years to have only excellent titles. If fun is important, this is an excellent game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Viticulture without a doubt. Unique experience.

I ended up buying both LOL

Thanks everyone for your input!

'discard one vine card'? When does that happen? Also, discard one wine order card? When can one do these things? Doesn't seem clear from the rules...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those are oddly named spaces. Really they are just the discard piles. You would discard a Vine Card after fulfilling the order. You would also discard those cards if you are over your hand limit. Unless I am missing something as well that makes those phrases pertinent.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, its not discard 'one' vine card, its discard down to 7, so it might be more than1. Also its not discard a wine order card, it's 'fill' an order card, which is marked elsewhere on the board. For a game with so much attention to detail, these confusing lapses are curious.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those are the discard piles. When you play a card or discard a card, you discard it to those piles.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm not sure I understand your question. Could you provide some context?

There are sitatuations where you can discard cards from you hand and when you do that you place them in the discard pile on the board. Is that what you're talking about?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Discard pile on the board is labelled "Discard One Wine Card" - it really should just say "Discard Pile"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ah, now I understand. I actually never thought about that, which is odd given how much I've stared at that board . Thanks.

The buyer says "Sell at least 1 grape at twice the regular price and gain 1VP".

If you sell more than one grape, does the card double the sell price of all the grapes you sell as that action, or just one of them.

Eg, I sell three grapes for 3, 2 and 1. Do I get 9 or 12?

The reading on the card would suggest that it doubles all of the grapes sell price, but I'm slightly unsure as that seems pretty powerful compared to the other money-making visitors, although I suppose it's specifically only useful in the mid-game rather than the early game when you want money the most. Still, it does seem immensely strong if you get it at the right time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Iain: Indeed, you double the price of all grapes sold with the buyer card (but you just get 1 VP, no matter how many you sell). The "sell grapes" action is actually not used very often, as money doesn't translate to anything more than a tiebreaker by the time you have grapes to sell at high prices.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great, thanks.

I have not played the second edition, and have not yet made a decision to upgrade. I am wondering whether any of you have played both, and prefer the original rules? In particular I am thinking of the Grande worker and the rule for making wine. Cheers!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I enjoy the rules for the Grande worker, but I prefer the original rules for making wine. In my opinion, they make the game more strategic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are the original rules for making wine?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1st rule: Make 1 "kind" of wine, as many bottle as you want/can
2nd rule: Make 2 "bottle" of wine. Don't mind the kind.

I like the first one as well. But it's not the easiest to explain to people that you can make 1 "kind" of wine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First edition, and it's not even close. I know many (most?) will disagree with me, but the second edition sort of nerfs much of what made Viticulture great. First edition is a tense, cutthroat affair that required long-term planning. Need two different kinds of wine? That'll be at least two actions - hope you can pull it off, partner. Now it's like, oh, ho-hum go ahead and make two different wines, and oh are the spots blocked? Then use that Grande worker and you can still do it.

One thing that second edition does that's more cutthroat than first edition is that you can block someone from the bonus spaces if you can't take advantage of the bonus spaces. I don't like that either - I like my games cutthroat, but only when it comes through strategic play or devilish chicanery. The obvious "Oh! I know he wants to plant two vines, and I can't but I'll go there to block him" doesn't do much for me. If you wanted to block me from planting two vines, you should have grabbed a vine card in the previous round. Your lack of planning should not be rewarded by letting you screw me.

Blegh.

I'm a purist, through and through. I know that almost everyone thinks the Grande worker makes the game better, and many think the 2nd edition rules make the game better (or more friendly, or easier to teach), but to me 1st edition Viticulture with no modification is sublime.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm enjoying this discussion, and you all are free to discuss the merits of first-edition gameplay vs. second edition. I will say that I think the second edition components are superior to the first. The glass tokens are a better size and the player mats are better designed (they have a designated spot for available workers and a winemaking key, and they're thicker and linen embossed). The box is also linen-embossed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I played & enjoyed both. On Saturday I gifted my first edition (with the second ed upgrade kit) to a friend of mine; I have no further need for it.

The grande worker is IMHO absolutely necessary - I felt that first edition was very limited with two or four players. The grande worker rectifies this - simple and elegant

I don't mind the wine-making rules - both work fine.

Cheers!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks guys, really interesting.

I really like the way wine is made in the 1st edition, it rewards efficiency (it seems to me).

I haven't tried playing with the Grande worker (I have them from the 1st ed kickstarter version) but the blocking hasn't been too egregious (until the very last year, where things tend to go a bit pear-shaped). Part of the game is doing things other players are not doing, and prioritizing carefully, so you don't get blocked. Maybe I just haven't played enough to get a sense of the problem
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the 1st printing, the wording was "crush grapes", and that was very confusing as to what crush grapes meant, along with the crush expert visitor.

I too had the 1st edition, when I received the Complete Collectors edition, I updated the 1st viticulture and gifted it to a friend, but left the 1st edition rules in the bottom of the box under the insert.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agree, some of the wording was a little inintuitive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1315663:
I had a friend who said she learned the game through a watch it played video. One of the things she told us was that once you built the Trellis your left field was your Trellis field and grapes with the Trellis symbol could only be planted there. Likewise your right field was your Irrigation field once it was built. The middle field could only take grapes needing neither. This means only cards with neither could be planted in your middle field.

In our last game I had a card with both symbols so I asked for the rulebook to check how the rulebook said they had to be planted. I found no reference to specific fields being tied to either structure and after pointing it out we agreed to play that no field was tied to any structure and once a trellis was built those grape types could be planted in any field.

The game owner acknowledged that this felt a lot more fluid cause before the middle field was rarely used however I just want to confirm which way is correct.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You're right, the fields aren't tied to any structure.

Once your structure is built it affects all fields.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BTW Rodney never says that in his video. In fact he gives the example that planting a vine that requires a structure may go in any of the three fields.

I just bought a first edition copy on eBay, and it includes the Aboriculture expansion. My question is should I buy the upgrade kit being sold? The expansion has the grande workers. What else do I need from the upgrade? Are there rules changes or anything else I need?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are some rule changes, but they should all be detailed on the Stonemaier games site. There's a couple board and card changes, which you might want the kit for.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are no rules included in the upgrade kit, but they can be downloaded for free in various languages here.

You can read about the changes in the second edition here.

I don't remember exactly what's in the upgrade kit and don't have it here.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The game works fine with 1st edition rules. I didn't get the upgrade kit yet, and haven't played with the second edition rules, but I wouldn't say it's essential.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for all the advice!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The upgrade kit has some additional vineyard mat graphics for wine-making and a slot for additional workers, plus revised versions of a few cards that were thought to be over-powered or too situational.

Components

This game is gorgeous. Everything, including the box itself, is top quality. The boards are sturdy, the cards are good quality, and the wooden bits are easily identified. The art is beautiful and just setting the game up gives you the feeling that you are in the Italian countryside looking over competing wineries. The rulebook and player aids are what all others should strive to be; clearly written with good examples. It is one of those rule books where a particular rule question might come up during play and it is answered clearly by a notation. You can tell this game was play-tested very thoroughly. I can't say enough good things about the presentation.

Theme & Gameplay

This is a medium-heavy Euro but I find that it incorporates the theme much better than most. If you were to sit down and write out the steps to get wine from field to table, it is included in the game. Everything from hiring workers, planting fields, picking and crushing grapes, to bottling and selling wine. It covers it all. This can be very useful when explaining it to new players. When I teach it, I usually start by asking them how they would make wine if they owned a winery. Most everyone answers with planting, picking, crushing, bottling, etc, so half of the game is already explained. The other half is just explaining how the mechanics allow you to perform all those necessary actions. Though heavy, the actual game play is very simple: place workers, make wine, fill wine orders. Be the first player to 20 points to trigger end game and hope you have the most points at the end of the final round.

Planning is everything in this game. Having an idea of what you want to do three turns ahead and then not getting distracted to follow through on that idea is key. In my opinion, this is a strategy game with little in the way of tactical maneuvering. Oh, you can play tactically, but I don't think you will do very well. That's not to say you should pass up actions that provide you with a solid benefit right now, but those should be the exception and not the rule.

I'm sure some of you are saying, "Wow, if I have a plan and get blocked I guess I'm just screwed, right?" Not at all, there are two ways to mitigate this. First, there are many actions you have to perform to make your plans come to fruition. So if you get blocked on one action, perform one of the others. Also, the 2nd Edition introduces your "Grande" worker. He lets you take an action that is blocked so you can always do what you need to do if you plan accordingly.

As I said before, planning is everything, but you have so few actions each year. Each action is so critical that you want to get maximum bang for your buck. Stick to your plan!!

I have played this multi-player twice and each game was a completely different experience. The first game I played very tactically and barely scored any points. I scuffled around with whatever I thought was the right thing to do at the time with no real end game goal in mind. Needless to say, I finished dead last by a lot. The second game, I went in with a plan. I would milk points from my tasting room each turn and try to fill small wine orders to grab 2-3 points here and there. I also used the wake up track to grab a point during several turns. I lead most of the game, but couldn't quite close it out and lost by 2 points. 25-23. I was really happy that I made a better accounting of myself.

What do I think?

Well, if you haven't figured it out by now, I really, really like this game. It is one of the few Euros that is both strategic and thematic. The only negative I might have is that that games can be very long. A 4-player game will last probably 2 hours, even with mildly experienced players, longer with new players. This is because of the necessary planning that goes into each turn. I have played the solo version using the online card deck (don't have the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
expansion yet) and it plays very well and very quickly. I tend to like games that give a solid winning condition for their solo games rather than "beat your best score".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
has you trying to beat 20 points over 7 years while the Automa player is randomly taking away actions on the board. It works beautifully and is a good way to learn different strategies.

If you are looking for a thematic, heavy Euro game with great components and don't mind sitting down and burning your brain for a couple of hours, pick up this gem. I give this a vintage 9.5/10.

Bonus

One of the irrigation tokens was broken in my copy when I bought it new. I opened a case on the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
website and had my new token in less than a week with no questions asked. So add "great support" to my list of positives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I agree with your review
This game needs to get higher on the BGG ranking

I have Viticulture 2nd edition and the Tuscany expansion. Ive played Viticulture about 4 times and last week i played it with the Tuscany expansion Tier 1 and 2. (The new board with extra actions, turn order track and the small map is so cool)

Playing my first game.

If I harvest grapes in the winter, at the end of the year phase do they age straight away e.g. they were harvested to the 4 space on the crush pad. Are they aged to the 5 space? Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave: They're two separate things. So if you harvest a field, placing grapes on your crushpad, they simply go on the matching number on the crushpad (1 to 1). After the winter season, you go through the end-of-year steps, one of which is aging grapes and wine. You do that for all grape and wine tokens regardless of when they were harvested.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you Jamey, I thought that was probably the case, as the rules seem very clear. I just wanted to check.

I'm learning the game using the Automa. Great game....

We were disussing this the other day and wondered if we had been playing incorrectly.

When placing a worker in a bonus space that gives £1 (for instance building a building) do you take it as a discount on the cost of the action? Or do you pay the full amount then gain the £1.

We have always played it as a discount. Doing it the other way would mean you would need the full cost before you take the action then you would get a £1 back.

Cheers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can claim bonuses before or after completing the action, so you can use that lira to pay for the building. Bottom of page 6 in the rules.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brill, cheers.

As a general rule, when the placement of a worker allows you to do more than one action, you may perform the actions in any order.

Ever since I saw that V1.0 had some flaws and Jeremy had changed some of the cards, I've not really wanted to play my copy (which I bought right before the rules changes were announced).

Buying premium the Kickstarter edition of Viticulture and Tuscany was a highlight. It cost a lot, but I loved that big box, I loved the components and the art design and everything.

Until I read the rules.

● Yoke is one worker per year, while the cart (one lira) location is unlimited workers per year. Why is Yoke not visually blue/yellow at the same time? As a game designer, you have essentially two options there: either have a new circle color that is used for both summer and winter, or have a different border for area that says that multiple workers can be placed on the same area. It is difficult to tell players that you can only place one worker on Yoke area, but can place multiple on cart area - when both look exactly the same.

● Page 5 of rulebook is confusing, there are Notes for rules that make no sense at the time when reading them. But I guess there was no other place for those notes.

● Can Yoke be used twice thanks to Grande Worker? Nothing in rulebook seems to say otherwise (am I blind?). Nothing in FAQ says otherwise (am I blind?). But I noticed some threads on the forums that said so. But the rulebook makes it clear that you can use Grande Worker on action spaces and no restrictions are mentioned.

● Player board carries no reminders to player about the rules for making blush and sparkling wine. This can be a huge source of confusion to players.

● There are other things in the game that are only hidden in manual as well, which is problematic and easy to forget, like the dual-use of Yoke which has two functions in Winter, but only one of them in Summer. I do understand correctly that you can only harvest in winter, right? Rulebook does not say you can harvest in the summer, but there are forum threads that claim otherwise.

● It's confusing that the rules don't mention how players can mark their fields as harvested, such as turning them upside down. Since players can harvest multiple times, but harvest one field only once, I assumed there was an easy guide for it to mark this.

● It is thematically difficult to explain to players that they can get grapes for free. But I guess this is mechanically so. And what is the thematic reason for gaining a victory point when having a Windmill and planting wine? Maybe I don't know about winemaking

Anyways, I absolutely love this game, but it has these rule loopholes that just annoy me a little in the polished second edition of the game. If anyone can clarify these details for me, I would appreciate greatly!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because there are other seasons with other colors in the extended board of Tuscany.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is: white. White action spaces can be used in all seasons. These are the Yoke, the $1/worker action space, and the private action spaces in the Tuscany expansions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actually, they don't. The cart one is bigger and can comfortably accomodate several workers, whereas the yoke one can't fit more than one, as do all others.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's arguably mentioned that the Yoke can only be used once per year, but I agree that it would have been worth it to include a clarification. I seem to recall that there's an official ruling by Jamey somewhere regarding that. It's also specifically mentioned in the Tuscany rules IIRC. In any case, you can only use the special ability of the Grande worker in the board, not in private action spaces. Of course, you may still use your yoke with him by using him as a regular worker.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes it does, in the side which has the markings - its in the "small cellar" area. There is a key on which grapes make blush and sparkling wine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The rulebook says that the yoke gives you a choice between two actions. There are no restriction on when you may use them, other than it only being usable once per year. So yes, you can harvest in the summer or uproot in the winter. This is a rules change from the first edition. Harvesting at the end of summer is often pretty useful.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can use anything you want (I have seen poker chips as a recommendation), but it's usually not too much of a problem in practice, as harvest spaces are pretty contested.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you get grapes for free? I'm not aware of a way. Re: the windmill, I don't really know.

When you have a card that says {all players may do x } and play it,now in turn order do you ask that player if he wants to do that action or just do something else? So the way I see it is the rest of the players have an option of either doing that x action or just do something else & then when it comes back to the player who played that card takes his next turn is that ok?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not really. All players get a chance to do "x" if they want as part of the resolution of the card. After they all have chosen whether to do "x" or not (and done "x" if they chose to), the turn of the player who played the card ends and it's now the turn of the next player.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When players make their "all players" decisions and enact them -- are they doing that in turn order? Or does the playing player go first? Etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We always resolve it in clockwise order because it's easiest, starting with the active player. Whether the active player goes first or last doesn't usually matter since the bonuses only trigger for other players doing the action.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technically the "all player" decisions should be made in wake-up order.

When one of the decks is exhausted and a game rule requires that card to be drawn, when is the discard pile reshuffled?

This is prevalent in a 6 player game so some clarification would be appreciated. Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You shuffle an exhausted deck when there are no cards to draw but the game requires you to draw. This is to keep some value to to certain visitor cards (Innkeeper comes to mind).

There can be a time when there are no cards available to shuffle due to no cards in either the discard or the draw piles - then the draw is ignored.

So on my third play of viticulture, there was just two of us.

(Sorry if this question has been answered elsewhere but i couldn't see it!)

It was a pretty fun and even game on the most part and the end was very close. But we had a bit of a discussion on the meaning of 'upto' for placing a worker on the crush grapes space and also when playing a winter worker.

So if I remember rightly the crush grapes space says you can crush upto two grapes into wines and the rule book says that you can only occupy a space if you can do/play the action.

So my friend places a worker on the crush grapes space and says done without crushing any grapes. We have a short debate about if you are placing a worker there then you have to perform the action. His point was that upto 2 means any number upto 2 and 0 is upto 2 so it was ok. My argument being that if you do 0 you are not actually performing any action at all so you cant place a worker there. He reluctantly concedes my point and places elsewhere. Was i correct?

This then leads on to upto issue number 2. So instead he moves his worker to play a winter worker card. This card is to crush upto 4 grapes I think it was. Soooo similar issue to before but the condition for placing a worker in the space is fine as he played a witer worker card. The question is can he actually play the card as he crushed 0 grapes, when the card said upto 4? This debate was a little longer than previous as my opinion was that if you do 0 crushing, then no action has been performed still, so you cant play the card. His argument was the same as before that 0 counts as upto the limit and is a valid option.

My thinking is that If I can eat upto 2 slices of a cake and I eat 0 slices of cake I have done no eating of the cake so have done no action, hence I cant place in action space and cant play a card and do 0 actions.

Please can someone confirm who was right? I don't mind being wrong and just want to know what the rules actually allow!

Thoughts?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The definition of "up to" is different between games. In some games "up to 2" means 0-2, but in Viticulture it specifically means 1-2. The FAQ on http://stonemaiergames.com/faq-viticulture/ explains this (emphasis mine):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
edit: I noticed the FAQ mentions cards, not board, but I guess the meaning of "up to" is consistent throughout the game.

Hey guys,

I was wondering, if I had a level 1 and level 2 grapes on my crush pad and I take the 'Make Wine' action, does it automatically become a Level 3 wine or can I have the option of creating two separate wines (Level 1 AND 2)?


Thanks for the help!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two whites or two red grapes in your crush pad make individual reds or whites on their own. You can combine only when making blushes and sparklings, as far as I know.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's correct--thanks Juan!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you guys!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why is that Jamey? If you can combine a red 4 with a white 3 to make a blush 7, why did you decide to disallow combining a white 4 and a white 3 to make a white 7? Same colour Grapes are blended at harvest and red and white grapes can be blended at crushing, but same color grapes can't be blended at crushing. Did you try this during play testing, and if so, how did it break the game?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, it's built into the value of the wine order and vine cards. The idea is the you can strategically plant your fields to produce high-value white or red grapes and/or harvest early so those grapes age over time and can produce high-value single-color wine. It requires more planning, and that balances out with the two-token sacrifice to make one blush token. I don't think we ever tested it any other way--it's been built into the values of the wine orders all along, so doing it any other way wouldn't work at this point.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the info Jamey. I'd been playing Harvesting wrong (failing to combine the grapes from each field) and when my error was pointed out to me it just jumped out at me that it should also be possible to blend wine from same-colour grapes. But if the game is predicated on being played a specific way, which is odd in an otherwise quite "open" game, then I for one have no interest in breaking it: it's too much fun to risk spoiling a single game in testing it.

Hi all (and hopefully Jamey)

Just received my Collectors Edition and the Treasure Chest today

and this is how the box transporting it arrived:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Also, the inside of the box had virtually no padding, it was just a sheet of brown paper to fill up one side of the box, nothing around the Game box itself...

After seeing the package I was amazed to see that the game box it self wasn't damaged... but maybe you should talk to the amazon fulfillment center Jamey because this was an extremely poor packaging job and was a miracle nothing was damaged...

I also recall reading that a replacement Merchant card should be in the package but nothing came in mine... I re-checked the box, even opened the brown sheet of paper to see if it was tangled up inside it but nothing... was it put somewhere else? I didn't open the game yet but I highly doubt it will be in there...

Finally, is there an entry for the Treasure Chest in the BGG database? I can't seem to find it

Cheers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too bad about the packaging, but at least it sounds like the game wasn't ruined. The replacement card should be inside the Tuscany Viticulture box itself, if I recall correctly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Treasure Chest is not a game, so I wouldn't expect it to appear in the game database.

[i]Edit: Viticulture, not Tuscany; cf. Ben's post.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Merchant card is loose in the Viticulture box, at least that is what it was like for me. Use it to replace the one that will be amongst the shrinkwrapped cards.

My package was similarly packaged, and I emailed Jamie about it. I would urge you to send him a photo of the inside as I did so he has some ammunition when taking Amazon to task for this. I had trouble picking it up without dropping it, as all the weight was on one side, so no wonder why your postie grabbed what they could of the box. Mine was dinged on one corner, but the winecrate took the brunt and the inner boxes are undamaged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inside the Tuscany box? but isn't that one the incorrect card? I thought the replacement card was only printed after the games were already packed and so they put the corrected card loose in the big package...

can someone confirm this?

Regarding the treasure chest, I know it's not a board game but BGG has listings for accessories like:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is inside the Viticulture box. It was printed after the deck of cards was shrink wrapped but before the box contents was collated and shrink wrapped. Mine was floating loose in the box but slide between the box and insert so was in great condition.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was indeed... Thanks Brian

Now... how can we create the BGG Entry for the Treasure Chest?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I hope you can't. As has been said, its not a game -OR- either an expansion/promotion for one.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is actually an "accessory" and should be entered into the database as an accessory. They do this for several games that have similar content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't have this so don't know the details, but you can add it yourself with this form (found under "Misc -> Add to Database: Accessory"

https://boardgamegeek.com/item/create/boardgameaccessory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But isn't the idea that those entries are tied to a game (which the Treasure Chest is not)? Otherwise I'd better get busy entering my stash of wooden cubes, houses, meeples, ziplock baggies, drawstring bags, card holders etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think that this is a little different in that it is a published set of components, that most likely has its own UPC code. This isn't buying a random assortment of cubes or picking up a generic set of baggies. It is specifically designed by a game company for games.

You can link to specific games if there is one in mind that it was meant for. If not, leave it blank.

I think the overriding factor is if this is something that can be sold/traded on the site and that people would actually want to buy/trade on the site. In that case, it should have its own entry beyond just "misc gaming."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paulo: I'm sorry to hear the packaging was poor. I had very specific instructions to Amazon.co.uk about this. Could you please send me photos of the game and the packaging inside the box? It's the inside that matters to them.

It sounds like some others in the comments helped you with the Merchant card. Indeed, it's inside the Viticulture game box.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Jamey... just sent you an email with the photos...

Regarding the Treasure Chest BGG entry, I completely agree with Brian... this isn't a random assortment of cubes ans stuff... it's a published accessory box from a publishing company... and something that I would like to have listed in my collection that I own because I think this is a Collection Item and not the Extra cubes and Dice I have in a cloth bag and that I carry over with me to my gaming groups in case something is needed...
To me they are completely different things
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paulo: Absolutely, I wish BGG would let me list it. The reason they gave me was that each Treasure Chest isn't for a specific game--it's for a variety of games.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aren't they designed for some games in mind though? It seemed that way to me when you introduced them.

Yes, they're designed for a lot of games. But BGG wants it to be for a specific game and only one specific game.

Trust me, I wish it could be listed on BGG, but I've tried, and they will not allow it. You all can write to their admins if you'd like them to change that rule.

Can you place more than 1 worker 0n the train a worker bldg & get 2 workers at the end of the winter?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, I don't see why not as long as you have the workers and money.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Definitely! As long as the action spaces are available (based on player count and where players have placed their workers), you could potentially place 4 workers on a single action space (1 regular worker on each of the 3 spaces in a 5-6 player game and a grande worker).

If the card says if each opponent does x you get a vp When does the opponents do this in turn order or immediately?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I play it as immediate. It gives the other players the opportunity to do something immediately, but then gives you victory points or whatever reward for anyone who takes the advantage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes but do the other players have to place a worker to do the x on the card or just do what the card says without using a worker and do they get an extra turn by doing that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They get to take the action immediately without using a worker, provided that they have whatever resource or prerequisite is needed. (E.g. if the cards says 'Opponents may plant 1 Vine,' they cannot plant a Vine without already having a Vine card and the structures and fields needed to plant it.)

If I harvested both my fields and I have A harvester card that says harvest up to 2 fields,Can I use this card even if I harvested my fields in this current year? The rules say you can only harvest one, or 2 with the bonus in a year.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every field can only be harvested once per year, so unless you have one or more unharvested field(s) the Harvester won't be of much use to you that year.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I place a poker chip on a field to indicate that it has been harvested, and remove all poker chips as part of the winter cleanup. The poker chips are particularly helpful when someone harvests in the summer using the yoke.

Each field can be harvested only once per year.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think I would just turn over the cards on a particular field once I'd harvested them for that year. Flipping 'em back over would be part of resetting the board after winter.

Hi all,

I just got this game - haven't played yet but can't wait to give it a shot. I have heard from several sources however that some of the visitor cards can be pretty unbalanced, and that this is being addressed in the upcoming Tuscany expansion. That said, I was wondering if anyone has come up with a variant to balance the cards out a bit - surely it wouldn't be hard to tweak the numbers?

Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With a few exceptions (which were addressed in the second edition), the visitors are pretty balanced. They are, however, rather situational - some of them are useful at the beginning of the game and some at the end, and getting them "out of season" does not help.

That said, it's not nearly as bad as to require a variant to fix. First, you do have some control - most of the "early helpers" are of the summer variety and most of the "late helpers" are of the winter variety, so you can control the ones you draw. And second and more important, there are plenty of ways to draw lots of cards - if you invest in them. If you are not fond of that particular part of the game, aim for an early Cottage, which is pretty strong anyway, and that will make most of your woes disappear.

I like to think of visitors in base Viticulture kind of like weather. If you prepare yourself for bad weather (draw lots of cards), you'll be assured to have a lot of options even in the face of suboptimal draws - but you'll spend resources at the expense of other possibilities. Or you may decide to not draw that many visitors and explore other options, but then you risk being stuck with worse guests than your neighbors.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1303328:
Hi,

Just got the collectors edition today and have been busy sorting the Viticulture box...

I notice that there are three cellar tokens for each player. Two of them seem very slightly larger than the other one. Do these represent 2 large and 1 medium cellar? I can only tell they are different sizes by holding them next to each other.

I haven't played the game yet, so I don't know if you need to recognise them as large or medium at a glance or whether the almost identical size is unimportant. But, I just thought I would ask!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
there are three that look quite similar. One is the cottage. That is the one with the offset door.

the other two are your cellars. The one with the smaller door is the medium cellar. The one with the larger door is the large cellar.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You place the tokens on the corresponding locations on your playmat so I look at which areas have tokens, the tokens themselves don't really matter except aesthetically.

There's a token for the medium and large cellars on your vineyard mat and one for the expanded cheese cellar on the player mat extension for the Formaggio expansion. If I remember correctly the cottage token also looks a bit like the cellars, so if you've only taken tokens from the base game box that might be the third of the tokens you're talking about.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The tokens are just from the Viticulture box (not looked at Tuscany yet).

Here's a photo...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The token on the right is the cottage I assume. The token on the left must be the medium cellar. The two in the middle I assume must be the large cellar.

I notice now that I do not have an irrigation token, so I assume that they must have given me an extra Large cellar instead of an irrigation token for each of the six colours.

*Edit - they definitely packed an extra bag of Large Cellars instead of a bag of Irrigation tokens. Raised a replacement request - I can proxy the Irrigation Token until they turn up. No big deal!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's a little strange. Yes, you do have extra large cellar tokens. Drop Stonemaier a line, they will likely send out replacement Irrigation tokens for you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That does sound like a packaging mistake. And yes, the one on the right is the cottage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian: Sorry about the packing mistake! We can send you the missing set of irrigation tokens if you fill out this form: http://stonemaiergames.com/replacement-parts/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No worries Jamey. I filled out the form earlier. These things happen - thanks for responding.

I have a question to resolve visitors clearly.

I experienced the situation like below.

1. I didn't have any vine card and I did not construct trellis.
I used landscaper card. (Choose 2: draw 1 vine card, uproot, plant)
First I chose draw action, and I acquired a pinot card. However I could not plant it, because I didn't have trellis to plant pinot.
In this case, should I uproot a vine card from my field, or can I Choose only one action of landscaper card?

2. While I use master vintner(Increase value of 1 wine token by +2 and fill 1) card, can I play only the action 'increase the value', if I don't have any solvable wine order card?

Thanks,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David:

Thanks for your question. You must fulfill every aspect of a card to play it at all, so on the landscaper in that situation, you would have to uproot a vine because the card says to choose 2.

Similarly, you wouldn't be able to play the master vintner if you can't fill a wine order.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks,
I always appreciate your quick response and kind answer.
Have a great day.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the example of the Landscaper do you have to be in the condition to choose 2 actions when you play the card?

For example, what if the OP did not have a field planted and was hoping to draw one and plant one. If he draws a field he can plant, he can take a second action. If not, he can't (and shouldn't have played the card at all). Can he play the card in the first place?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David: Honestly, I've gone back and forth about that card. Technically, if you use it to draw a vine card and then you can't plant a vine card, the card forces you to take a second action, which is to uproot a vine card. But that really isn't in the spirit of the game. So the way I play it is that draw a vine card and if it is possible for you to plant a vine card (any card in hand), you must do so, even if it's suboptimal.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1298875:
It's nice when a game can teach you a few things about its subject matter.

Playing Viticulture can teach you... (in my somewhat liberal interpretation)

* Grapes are apparently harvested in the winter (easier to pick frozen?), not in August-September. Well, that is unless you possess a yoke, which somehow makes the grapes ready for harvesting any time of the year. Awesome.

* Grapes improve with age? I'd heard about fermenting whole grapes, but didn't realize that leaving them for years allows you to make instant fine wine. Also didn't realize there was such a market for old grapes. Nice!

* Can't expect up-front payment for wine shipments; it takes years to get the money back. But if making quick money was the goal, people would just sell their old grapes I suppose.

* Evidently the types of wine you can make depends on the size of the cellar you've got. Don't think about making rose wine if you only have a small cellar.

* Apparently you need to obtain a license or something to do anything at all on your own vineyard. Oh, and it seems they are in limited supply too. Too late getting your license in? Too bad, you'll have to wait till next year...

I was thinking that one day I'd get my own vineyard but now I'm thinking maybe I should consider opening a brewery instead

I am sure there are plenty of other fun facts to be learned from this game as I play it more.

P.S. What's this deal with deciding once a year when to start work in the morning?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wine industry is heavily unionized. Once you negotiate the shift start time, you can't change that until the contract is up for renegotiation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1296180:
On page 8 of the rules, it says the Yoke can be used to either uproot a vine card or harvest one field. However, on page 9, the rules say the Yoke action during the Winter phase is to harvest one field. Does this mean you can only Uproot in the Summer phase? I was under the impression that a player could use the uproot or harvest action in either the summer or winter phase, provided they have the yoke built.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the first edition of Viticulture (often referred to as Viticulture 1.0), the action of the yoke was specified by the season; you could uproot in summer or harvest in winter.

In the second edition (2.0), you may use the yoke to perform either action in (IIRC) any season within which you are placing workers (2 seasons on the standard board, 4 seasons on the extended board).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Eric, that's correct. Aaron, I think you might be looking at the first-edition rulebook (but I could be wrong--typos happen!) If so, I'd recommend looking at the current edition: http://stonemaiergames.com/rules/

While playing with only the base game, 2 player, standard board, and only advanced visitors (mixed in with all the base visitors) from Tuscany, I managed to finally pull off a win using only the starting vine tonight. It relies heavily on harvesting every year to keep grapes flowing into the grape pads. You need to be harvesting grapes in the first year if at all possible.

Build the trellis, plant the vine, harvest the fields. If you're lucky enough to get the Summer Visitor card that lets you plant a vine with no structure requirement, as your random one at the beginning, you're even better off.

You also need the yoke so there's no way you can be blocked from harvesting so get this built as soon as possible, don't wait on it. You really want a steady stream of grapes flowing into those pads and aging as you get yourself set up. Next up get that Cottage built. You need to be drawing lots of visitor cards so you can get extra actions to fill orders, or extra ways to draw order cards.

The only other structures you really need are the cellar upgrades and maybe (late game for that extra squeeze of VP's), the tasting room, so you can give tours for an extra VP every turn the last few turns.

I find the 4 workers, plus the El Grande are just about enough, don't waste time going for the 5th one.

Also, get order cards often, you need ones that are straight forward and simple and balanced because you are constantly feeding 1 red and 1 white into the pads, nothing fancy or slanted in one direction or the other until late game when it's your last order. I admit there's a fair bit of luck in this part, but if you can get a Cottage up quickly, you can be drawing visitor cards that let you draw more cards hopefully.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You should write a strategy guide, Murr! These are great tips.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, I'll give it a shot when the game doesn't feel like that "How to Make Wine" poster that I sent you a link to a few months back
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've won that a couple of times. What I also found helpful was getting enough wine orders that you pulled two or three sparking wines. I didn't bother with a cottage.

Sparkling wine orders can be assembled with low-value grapes, and earn 5-6 points each (7 if you can manage the correct spot).

You can do this sometimes with just the original workers and using the temp two or three times.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I actually just tried a strategy last night with the extended board where I used the "trade" action to trade for the equivalent of a pinot harvest (1-value red and white grape tokens--I traded twice) several times early on in the game. I started slow as a result, but then had a a huge turn followed by two solid turns for the win.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kudos to you for being able to win with that strategy. Maybe it's just me, but that seems intentionally difficult. Were you trying it just to see if you could do it, or was it an attempt to streamline, like the starvation strategy in Stone Age?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeremiah: I rarely plant much in my fields (though usually I regret that near the end of the game. My strategy is usually to plant a field early on that gets me red and white, and then harvest that field every year, never missing a harvest. I thought I could accent that strategy by trading for a lot of grape tokens through the trade action, just to get a ton of grapes in circulation to make any wine I wanted. I want to try it again with a more balanced approach. I do like that the trade action works well for getting grapes on the crush pad if I'm not able to plant the first year.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's actually my default strategy, to my detriment. I need to be more flexible in responding to the wine orders I get. If you draw one, or especially two, high-point wine orders that rely on blushes and sparkling wines, the single-pinot can make for quick win. If you draw the 4-3-2 red/white wine orders, you'll struggle to produce enough grapes.

Of course, on the extended board, being able to buy grapes changes this to a degree.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ah, I don't have Tuscany, (although it's at the top of my want list) so I was unaware of the trade for grapes action.

Obviously you've played it more than me, but I generally try to get more than one vine into a field and then harvest it every year.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, what did you use to trade for those grapes (between cards, $, or VP)? I mean early on, I am usually lacking in ALL of those areas! :-) And then to be able to trade multiple times with such very limited resources? I rarely have enough money to buy structures or another worker early on, let alone trade for grapes - and then multiple times to boot. I also rarely have 2 cards that I would want to get rid of. I am still trying to figure out the relative values of each of those items, at various stages of the game. So what do you feel is worth giving up in such trades?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If I use that strategy, I usually use victory points and cards. If you've played with the extended board, there are options on the wake-up track that give you more cards than others, so you typically end up with an abundance of cards after a few turns. A cottage also helps, and playing some visitor cards will net you extra cards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1293887:
On visitor cards like the Landscaper: "Choose two - draw 1, uproot 1, or plant 1". Can you do one of the actions twice, e.g. can one play the landscaper and plant 2 vines?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strictly speaking, if it says choose two, it means to me that you do two of them once.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My wife and I both read those cards to mean that you needed to choose two of those three presented options.

In your example, I would not consider planting two vines as a viable action, but I will defer to Jamey for a definitive ruling.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John: Adrian and Juan are correct--you choose 2 of the 3 options in any order.

I'm just doing my first play-through and don't understand how you can crush a grape valued at 7 - 9. If the max a field can hold is 6, how would you get a wine of greater value? Maybe it's the effect of a visitor card that I haven't seen yet, but any help is appreciated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the end of every year you age your grapes and wine, increasing their values by 1. This is found on the back page of the rulebook.

I know there must be something not too expensive way to strap this edition to a handle so that I can carry this. Even putting in and taking out of a bag is a chore.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can fit almost everything in the Tuscany box if you only carry one of the boards - actually, if you leave out the base board plus the Formaggio/Arboriculture mats the box closes perfectly (that's how I store mine), and adding the mats only adds a bit of height (enough to make it not quite fit the CE sleeve with the Viti box, sadly, but it's not really a problem otherwise). It makes for a pretty heavy box, but it's probably the best deal you can get on game density.

Even if you get everything in the Tuscany box, it'll only overflow about half an inch or so - also pretty easy to carry around.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I FOUND SOMETHING IT IS CALLED STRAP A HANDLE

Hilo ID 1290924:
With Tuscany's pending arrival the wife and I have been getting in a few games to prepare for all the new expansions. The second edition rules really help smooth out the 2-player game, however I still think there is a little too much variance in drawing random vines and orders. While the card randomness is a good way to keep the game fresh, it also leads to wasted actions. Jamey has addressed similar concerns in past threads, advising that drawing wine orders earlier and then preparing your vineyard to match can increase efficiency. He has also cautioned against using a card draft similar to Ticket to Ride, as it would make the game much more prone to AP. I offer the following variant which reduces the luck of the draw a bit without adding time:

1) Separate the red and white vines, shuffle, and place the red stack on top.
2) Separate the 1 and 2 lira orders, shuffle, and place the 1 lira order stack on top.
3) Draws may be taken from either the top or bottom of the vine and order decks.

We've only tried these changes twice so far, but we have enjoyed having a bit more control of the winemaking process by choosing between small or large orders, and then collecting the appropriate vines to fill them. The extra control may speed the game up a little, as players will be less likely to have inefficient draws.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where do the Pinot grapes go?

Standard Viticulture is a game where you have to be adaptable. I think your game would be OK for a learning variant, but you're missing out on part of the experience.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since we've been playing 2 player, we just split the remaining four and put two in each stack.

I hear what you're saying, and understand that adaptability is important. Some people have mentioned too much variance in the value of visitors, however we have enjoyed that random part of the game, especially with the second edition updates. Unfortunately, we're experiencing that in such a short game, drawing completely random vines and orders can make or break you, similar to what ddyer has commented on before. Dividing each deck into two seems to be a reasonable step that doesn't take away too much chance.

I read over your 6 turn win in a 6-player game without filling any wine orders. I wonder if some of our issue is due to the lack of bonus spaces in the 2-player game; performing extra draws and getting a vp for selling grapes look like great options. Fewer draws make dead cards have a bigger impact, and there are a couple more dead cards in 2-player (your 5-point wedding party play couldn't happen, for example). I'm curious to see if the expanded board in Tuscany helps out.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I agree that the lack of bonuses slow down the 2-playwer game.

One good variant on that is to give each player 3-4 bonus tokens. When you want/need to use a bonus, use the token.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Personally I don't think that there is a problem, but such things are of course subjective. No matter what I think that your variant is a rather elegant solution.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's a good point, Eric. The original Grande worker rules opened it up a bit by allowing limited bonuses in the 2-player, but I do think the newer Grande rules are better overall to limit getting completely blocked out. I really think shifting just a few bonuses to the left would help out in a major way, specifically Draw Vine, Draw Order, and Sell Grapes (a mostly unused spot without the vp boost).

Now that my KS Tuscany has arrived (the metal coins are fantastic!) I've noticed that 10 of the 16 spots on the new board have the bonus available in 2-player games. Also, Jamey's strategy tip on page 11 directly addresses my concern above (what to do about lack of vine/order synergy) and offers three newly created solutions (Card Exchange, Buy Grapes, and the Sell One Wine Token action).

Looking forward to getting this to the table over the long weekend, as it seems the 2-player game is getting a nice boost, to include the Advanced Visitors that are much more evenly balanced. I'm a bit surprised that a couple of these changes weren't made to the 2nd edition of the base game, because a few would really help without adding much complexity. Then again, they probably took a little while to develop, and help make the expansion a better product and opportunity to support Stonemaier Games.

Got my Viticulture/Tuscany crate last night a couldn't wait to break it out. Fantastic game, first-rate components! The metal coins are really, really nice - as much an upgrade as the nice Euphoria resource tokens.

There was a Winter Visitor - I forget his name - but his effect was to upgrade a wine token +2 and fill a Wine Order. In order to play him, do you have to have a Wine Order in hand and the wine to properly fill it?

Based on a recent Euphoria question, I feel like I know what the answer will be, but would like to be sure. Last night, I just wanted my wife to enjoy playing so I said "yeah, just discard that wine order and consider it filled!" But I do want to play it right next time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, you sure need the wine as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You need a wine that fills the wine order, but you may apply the +2 to the wine first so that it qualifies. So, if you have a 6 white, an order for an 8 white, and a large cellar, you may first apply the +2 before filling the order.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That does clear it up - thanks very much!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just a small note about placement of the “Available Worker” sticker. The “Gain 1 VP” printed under the Tasting room on the original player mat is slightly in a lower spot on the card. If you match the “Available Worker” sticker to the exact placement in relation to the new player mat the sticker will cover part of the “Gain 1 VP”. I found it easier to align the bottom of the sticker along the top edge of the Cellar roof, this gives you a reference to place the sticker level compared to the cellar, and does not cover the “Gain 1 VP”.

To get the points, is the action:

Or

Uproot 1 and discard 2 fields

Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael: Just to make sure we have our wording right here, you never actually discard fields in the game. You can uproot and discard vine cards, though.

The Horticulturist summer visitor card reads: "Plant any 1 vine even if you don’t have the structure(s) required OR uproot and discard 2 vine cards to gain 3 VP".

The word OR separates those two options. You can:

1. Plant any 1 vine even if you don't have the structure(s) needed to plant that vine.

OR

2. Uproot and discard 2 vine cards to gain 3 VP.

In the rules of Tuscany, there is a tip about what visitor cards of Viticulture to use with the new cards. Four cards are mentioned there that I don't have:
Volunteer crew
Wedding party

Did those cards dissappear in the second edition?

These cards are part of the New Visitors expansion in Tuscany.

Actually, those cards are in Arboriculture (but very close, Holger! ).

They are a part of Aboriculture, but are perfectly compatible with the base only or any of its expansions, so once you open Aboriculture, many people just leave them in the decks.

That's a good point, Eric. The cards have no thematic ties to Arboriculture, so they can easily be mixed in with all the other visitors at any time.

Hi!

If i have a wine order card what needs a 5 red and a 2 white wine, and i have exactly one red 5, and exactly one white 4 wine, than i can fulfill this order? If yes than what happened to the white 4 wine, it decreases to white 2 wine, or it will "disappear" from my cellar? Or i need exactly that value of wine in my cellar as the card wants?

Thanks for the help!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can use those ti fill the order. The white 4 is removed as if it was a 2. You can always use higher value wine to fill an order but you do not get "change" back.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Todd! That's correct. kisnord, when you fill a wine order, you remove the wine tokens you used from your cellar even if they were over the value you needed. They don't need to be the exact value on the wine order card.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for the clarification!
We played it wrong then, because we understand that we need exactly the same value wine, that the order wants. It was much harder to fulfill the orders, but we found it very interesting. It opens some interesting strategy choices especially for planting.
So if someone thinks that the game is too easy, or simply wants an advanced play session, i highly recommend that use this rule.

Seller: Welcome to Snobbery Vineyards. How may I help you?
Buyer: You got any cheap wine?
Seller: No, we've run out, but I'll let you have this lovely 9 year old Montepulciano for the same price. You'll find that the soft notes of tobacco and spice simply bounce off the palate to create...
Buyer: Sorry, I really need the cheap stuff. It's that or nothing.
Seller: Fine. <shakes head> Come back next year and I'll have some Two Buck Chuck bottled up for you.

I'm sorry if I'm being dense, but the rules appear ambiguous to me on this issue. When the rules mention harvesting a value of 4 red grapes, but the 4 space being taken on the red crush pad, it tells you to check the next lowest space (in this case being a 3). What if the 3's taken, do I look for a 2? 1? Do the rules mean to tell me to look for the next lowest available crush space? Sorry for being a fool... Everything else is crystal clear : )
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, you go to the next smallest available space in your crush pad, so in your example you'd get a 2-valued grape token (assuming the 2 space is empty, of course). If the 2 happened to be occupied, then you'd go to the 1 spot. The only way you wouldn't get a grape token is if every place down to the 1 spot is already taken.

Hi!

1. After you built the York, you can uproot during summer or you can harvest during winter. Am i understand this right?

2. For example in a two player game, my opponent placed her worker on a spot, then i place there my Grande too. Later she wants to place her Grande on that space too. Is it legal? Can someone place his/her Grande on a spot where another players Grande is?

Thanks for the answers!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) No. You can uproot a vine or harvest a field EITHER in sommer or in winter, when you have built the yoke.

2) There is no limit to the number of grande workers that can be placed on an occupied spot.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ad 1. The Yoke may be used at any time. You may therefore use it to harvest during summer (but remember that each field may only be harvested once every year).

Ad 2. Rule-of-thumb: There is always room for a Grande, even if there are no available spots. However, bonuses are only awarded if the Grande is actually placed on an available spot with a bonus.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actually, there's a small caveat - there's always room for the Grande, but only in the main board, not in any of the player-specific action spaces. So you may not, for example, use a regular worker plus a Grande to get two uses out of your Yoke.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you Guys!

Its clear now, we found that harvesting in the summer is a bit strange, thats why we want a clarification.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, the Yoke actually used to work that way in the first edition (you could only harvest in the winter or uproot in the summer), but it was changed in the 2nd edition of Viticulture for consistency with other action spaces.

It is indeed a bit unthematic, but it opens many interesting strategic avenues, specially if you throw some of the Tuscany bits in the mix. For example, when it's clear that players before you in turn order will crowd you out of the harvest spots, you can use the yoke at the end of the summer and jump straight to making wine for your first winter (or fall) action if need be.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can I use York more than one time in a year since its place is circled by dotted line, like the "Gain $1" spot does.
spot?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, you may only use the Yoke once per year.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's correct. Many players/workers can use the "Gain $1" spot because it's a big circle.

Played a game of this. Can I ask do any people see the 'grow a worker' ability as unbalanced in the game? In our game literally the person with most workers won, second most workers got second. Taking one action to permanently increase you workforce is a bit suspect (overpowered) to me. In many other games such a critical action would be counterbalanced with some kind of increased upkeep cost so that you couldn't go extreme on the action, but there is no such thing here... 3(4?) coins for a worker multiplies value exponentially, surely?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In my plays I haven't found extra workers to be overpowered, the main reason being the game is so tight, there are only a few things you can actually legally do on your turn, and the spots get filled up fast. People who gets lots of extra workers usually don't get a chance to use them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm sure you know what you are talking about, but that was definitely not what happened in my game. Lots of space for the extra workers to do their extra actions. Running out of slots was not a problem.

I'm sure there is a hard limit to the fields and what they can support; but I can't recall offhand what it is.

I'm reading through the PDF but for some reason am unable to find it.

Can anyone help; what is the maximum (if any) each field can support?

Thanks now
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's been a bit since I've played but I thinks it's a total value of 7

Just checked the rules and its a value of 6

Hello there

I have 2nd edition, and I am wondering about when a player can legally play a Grande worker
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When it says "rules to the left" to what does it refer to?

Can players use their Grande worker immediately without playing any normal workers?

It says multiple players may place their grande worker; does this also include on the same spot/location?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amarjit: That sentence is literally referring to the rules noted to the left of that paragraph in the rulebook.

A grande worker is exactly the same as a regular worker, so on your turn, you can either place a regular worker or a grande worker. There are no rules restricting how multiple players place their grande workers.

The only difference between a grande worker and a regular worker is that a grande worker may be placed on an already full action to perform that action.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh okay, my mistake. I am reading the PDF so its all like linear. My fault!

I understand now what a Grade worker does. Thanks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, any number of Grande workers may use their special ability in the saqme location.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamey, my group understand reading from rules this way.

If you place your grande on other action space (free space without bonus) you can still use bonus with that action. Is that right or wrong?

We think that way because it's written that you can't use bonus if action space is full.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ivan: Just like any worker, the grande worker only gets the bonus if he's placed on an action space with a bonus. That's the only time he'll get a bonus. If he's placed on an action space without a bonus or on the art of a full action, he does not get the bonus.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It used to be correct, but this rule has been changed. The Farmer is now the special worker that can be used to take a bonus on a non-bonus space.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you Jamey & Eric
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamey,

Can you use the Grande to use an action for a second time. ( eg can I plant a vine and then use my grande to plant a second vine?)

The rules didn't seem to say you couldn't. But my wife didn't think it seemed fair

Thanks

B
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian: Yes, that's definitely allowed. There are no restrictions to the number of workers you can place on an action (except for the number of action spaces available). The grande worker's special ability lets you overlook the availability of action spaces and simply place on any fully occupied action to take it.

Of course, by using 1 worker to plant a vine and a grand worker's special ability to plant another vine (in a 2-player game), you no longer have that grande worker to use in the winter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So on an area (5-players) its possible to have the 3 action spaces all filled with regular workers then to have some or all (5) grande workers in one action ?
--we had that at end game trying to all fill our last orders and want to know if this is actually correct
-thank you
-Jim
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That is correct. At least, that is how I have played.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's right, there is no limit to the number of grande workers that can be placed on an action.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seemed a bit too strong when more than one player used the grande on the same action. But I am glad we did that correctly and looking forward to trying it again. I never judge on one play .. could be that I misinterpreted a rule, or other players we not into it, etc..
So...cant wait to play again :-) Especially since I learned along the way some errors in strategy i had made and want to try a different approach

It’s fair to say designers Jamey Stegmaier and Alan Stone had a pretty good 2013. Their two successful Kickstarter campaigns (for Viticulture and Euphoria) initiated their company’s emergence as a small publisher recognized for their design of Euro-style worker placement games. Both games were highly regarded within the board game community upon release, and in fact both have done so well, they’ve already seen second editions. Earlier this year I took a look at Euphoria and was vastly impressed with how well the game was able to merge its theme and mechanics together. A sort of symbiotic relationship that fueled what I think to be one of the most unique worker placement games on the market. Since then, Viticulture has been one that I’ve been interested in trying, and was finally able to pick up when the second edition released this past month.

In Viticulture (second edition), players partake in the wine-making business, as owners of their own vineyard. Each Round is separated into the four seasons of a year, during which players will send workers out to perform various tasks and jobs, whether it be planting vines in the field, harvesting, crushing grapes, bottling wine, fulfilling wine orders, etc. Visitors may stop by your vineyard during the year and will be able to assist you in various ways. Victory Points are collected mainly through fulfilling wine orders, and these wine orders will also award a player residual payments that he can collect at the end of each year for the rest of the game, helping to increase his income. The player that reaches 20 Victory Points (reputation within the wine-making business) or more by the end of a year, is declared the winner.

Setup
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The top portion of the game board houses the various cards that will be used during the game. Players will shuffle the individual decks of cards and place them in the spaces that correspond with their color. The Vine (green) cards will go in the space farthest on the left, next the Summer Visitor (yellow) cards, then the Wine Order (purple) cards, and finally the Winter Visitor (blue) cards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Rooster track determines turn order from year to year. The higher a player’s Rooster token is placed on the track, the earlier that player is requiring his workers to be at work. The lower a player’s Rooster token is placed on the track, the later his workers will start their day, however they will reward that player for his generosity with increased bonuses. Players will need to balance getting an earlier start with the bonuses they will receive for rising later in the day. At the beginning of the game, all players will place their Rooster token near the track to be used during the upcoming Spring phase.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Cork token represents the player’s progress on the Victory Points track. Player’s will place their Cork on the “start” space on the track. It is possible during the game to spend Victory Points in order to achieve certain actions, therefore even though players begin the game with 0 Victory Points, they are able to go in the negative by 5 Victory Points on the track. Remember, the player that can reach 20 Victory Points wins the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each time a player is able to fulfill a wine order, they may receive residual payments from that customer year after year. At the beginning of the game, players will place their Wine Bottle tokens on the center portion of the residual track. As player’s receive residuals, they will place these tokens on the increased amount. Players can never receive more than 5 lira worth of residual payments from year to year.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each player has their own Player Board, which contains three fields for planting grape vines, various areas to build different types of buildings, an area containing crush pads, and cellars for storing their final bottled inventory. Each player receives a Pinot grape card (from the green deck), a randomly drawn Summer Visitor card (from the yellow deck), and 3 lira (coins). They will also begin the game with 2 regular Workers and 1 Grande Worker. Their various building tokens can be placed near their player board, but these tokens are not used until they have paid to construct these.


Finally, the transparent Crush Pad tokens are placed in a general area near the main game board, along with the various lira tokens. After setup is complete, the play area should look something like this:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gameplay

As mentioned before, Viticulture plays over the course of a number of Rounds until a player is able to reach 20 Victory Points. Each Round is divided into the four seasons of a year; Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter. Each season provides various mechanics that while different from season to season, work together to show how wine-making goes from the planting of a single grape vine, to the ultimate fulfilling of a wine order. Let’s take a look at each of these seasons and what they entail.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each Round beings with the Spring phase, where turn order is determined. Remember that the Start Player is determined at the beginning of the game. At the beginning of each of the subsequent Rounds, this Start Player marker will rotate counter-clockwise. The Start Player will not necessarily go first during each season of the year. He simply has the option of where to place his Rooster token on the turn order track before anyone else. After placing his token, he will take the corresponding reward listed next to that space. Then moving clockwise, each of the opposing players will place their Rooster tokens in the remaining available spaces and immediately take their provided rewards.

After all Rooster tokens have been placed, the established turn order for the rest of the year (Summer, Fall and Winter) will correspond to this track (starting with #1 through #7). While players requiring their workers to get up earlier in the year will have earlier turns throughout the year, players going later will receive better rewards for letting their works sleep in longer. The following bonuses are provided depending on the Rooster position on the track:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The player choosing the 1st space on the track will receive no reward, though they are guaranteed the first turn during the Summer, Fall, and Winter seasons of that year.

- The player choosing the 2nd space on the track will draw a new Vine card from the draw deck.

- The player choosing the 3rd space on the track will draw a new Wine Order card from the draw deck.

- The player choosing the 4th space on the track will receive 1 lira.

- The player choosing the 5th space on the track can either choose to drawn a new Summer Visitor or Winter Visitor card from the draw decks.

- The player choosing the 6th space on the track will receive 1 Victory Point.

- The player choosing the 7th space on the track will receive an additional Worker to use during the year.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Workers will be available for work during both the Summer and Winter months. As the proprietor of your own vineyard, it will be your job to decide where best to send these workers and what tasks and jobs they should perform. The main section of the game board is split into two halves, represented by yellow actions spaces where workers can be placed on the left side of the board, and blue actions spaces where workers can be placed on the right side of the board. The yellow actions spaces represent the different tasks workers can perform during the summer months, while the blue actions spaces are for the winter months. Each action area has three spaces in which a worker can be placed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As is standard with the worker placement mechanic, once a worker is placed on an action space, the player immediately performs that action. What is unique in Viticulture, is that while normal workers will block opposing players from using that action area if all the available spaces are full, the player’s Grande worker can be placed on any action area, regardless of action space availability. This may seem a bit overpowered at first, but take note that for most of the game (until they can train more workers), players will only have two normal workers and one Grande worker to use for both the Summer and Winter months, combined. Workers used in the Summer cannot then be used in the Winter. Apparently, they have pretty powerful unions within the field of wine-making. Therefore, there are plenty of opportunities for blocking opposing players from certain actions, and the use of the Grande worker becomes a major part of preplanning your actions before Summer begins.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For instance, Player C (yellow) may want to Plant a Vine during the Summer and Harvest from that vine during the Winter. However, the action spaces to Plant a Vine have already been filled. He could place his Grande worker there, however doing so will open up the possibility that he could be blocked from performing his desired action of Harvesting during the Winter month.



Let’s first take a look at the various Summer tasks and then later I’ll go over those available in the Winter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the player sends a Worker to this space, he is allowed to draw a new Vine card. You’ll notice that this area (along with every other action area on the game board) contains a bonus for the worker that is sent to the center action space. In this case, that worker would be able to draw 2 Vine cards. There are nine different types of grape vines in the game. Each Vine card references the name of the grape, the color wine that can be produced from that grape, and the overall value of the grape. Some wines also have a building icon located in the top left corner of the card that represents the type of structure that is required in a vineyard before that vine can be grown.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For instance, the Merlot vine card requires an Irrigation structure in the player’s vineyard before it can be planted. Once planted it will produce red grapes with a total value of 3.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The main goal of any vineyard entrepreneur is to fill Wine Orders. To do this, one must grow the grapes that will eventually be harvested, crushed, bottled, and sold. By sending a worker to one of the spaces at this action area, that worker can Plant 1 Vine card in one of the three fields on their personal player board (or 2 if using the bonus space), either by placing it in an empty field or attaching it to other vine cards already present in a field. The only stipulation to this is that the total value of the cards in a field can not exceed 6.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For instance, Player A decides to plant the Merlot vine (value of 3) in one of his fields. His vine cards in the 1st field currently have a total value of 5, while his single Trebbiano vine card in his 2nd field has a value of 2. Since the Merlot vine is worth 3, he could not place it in his 1st field (thus exceeding the maximum value of 6), but could add it to the field with the Trebbiano vine, or place it in his empty 3rd field.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As mentioned, many of the Vine cards will require certain structures before they can be produced in the vineyard, however many other structures are available for construction on the player’s personal board and each of these structures provide various bonuses. By sending a worker to this Summer action area, the worker can construct 1 structure (or 2 if placed on the bonus space). Each structure has a specific token that matches that structure that will be placed on the player’s board to show that it has been built. It’s unique to see a publisher that will go out of its way to make individual components for each building, and is quite refreshing. Let’s take a look at the various structures:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The Trellis costs 2 lira and will allow players to produce Pinot, Syrah, and Trebbiano vines. Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay vines require both a Trellis and an Irrigation structure.

- The Windmill costs 5 lira and rewards a player 1 Victory Point every time they plant a new Vine card.

- The Cottage costs 4 lira and rewards a player with an additional Summer of Winter card when drawing cards during the Fall season (we’ll take a look at this phase next).

- The Yoke costs 2 lira and provides an extra space for players to place a worker. By doing so, they can either remove vine cards from a field or can use it as an extra space to take a Harvest action.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The Irrigation structure costs 3 lira and will allow players to produce Merlot and Sauvignon Blanc vines. Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay vines require a Trellis and an Irrigation structure.

- The Tasting Room costs 6 lira and rewards a player 1 Victory Point each time they send a Worker to the action space to give a tour of the vineyard.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Finally the player’s Cellar begins as a small structure that can only hold bottled red and white wine that is valued at 3 or less. A player can pay 4 lira to upgrade to a medium cellar (max value of 6 and space for blush wine) and then another 6 lira to upgrade to a large cellar (max value of 9 and space for blush and sparkling wine).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summer Visitors can help with constructing building, planting vines, and assisting with the overall preparation that goes into making sure the vineyard has what it needs for a successful Winter harvest. A player can send a worker to this action space in order to play 1 Summer card from their hand, and take the immediate effect listed on the card (or may play 2 Summer cards if using the bonus space). We’ll take a more in depth look at how Visitors work when discussing the Fall phase.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As players harvest grapes from the vines in their field, these grapes will be sent to their crush pads. During the Winter phase, these grapes can be converted into bottled wine, however during the Summer phase, players can send workers to this space in order to sell grapes straight from their crush pads. The player will receive a number of lira equal to the value of the grape.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So for instance, selling a bundle of red grapes worth 5 would gain the player 2 lira, while selling a bundle of grapes worth 2 would only gain the player 1 lira. Players taking the bonus space when taking this action is also awarded 1 Victory Point.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A quick way to earn some extra income is to give a tour of your vineyard to the public. Player’s can send a worker as a tour guide to this space in order to give a tour and immediately gains 2 lira (3 lira if occupying the bonus space).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vineyards and wineries are known for being open throughout the year for public visitation. In Viticulture, visitors will arrange weekend trips to the winery in the Summer and Winter seasons. During the Fall, players will collect these visitor cards to use in future Summer/Winter months. Thematically, you can think of the Fall season as a time when visitors make reservations to the vineyard for the upcoming year. There is an action space in the Summer section to play Summer Visitor cards from your hand, as well as an action space in the Winter section to play Winter Visitors. For the most part, Summer Visitors will assist with income collection and the preplanning steps that go along with the actions spaces in the Summer months. The Winter Visitors on the other hand will assist more with the harvesting, bottling, and completion of wine orders. During the Fall phase, each player is allowed to select either 1 Summer Visitor card or 1 Winter Visitor card from the draw decks (2 cards if they've built a Cottage), and add it into their hand. Each visitor when played provides a bonus ability that is normally more powerful than the standard actions spaces.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For instance, as seen on the left, when an Architect is played as a Summer visitor, the player may build any structure for 3 lira less than it would normally cost. The Surveyor is another Summer visitor that when played will gain a player 1 Victory Point for each of his fields that have at least 1 Vine card in them. Finally, the Merchant is a Winter Visitor that allows a player to fill a wine order and sell at least one grape as one complete action. If he is able to complete both of these, he gains an extra Victory Point.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the most part, workers will be used to harvest, bottle wine, and fulfill wine orders during the Winter season. The Winter phase works exactly as the Summer phase, but with actions spaces available on the right side of the board (blue spaces). Using the same turn order, players will take turns placing their remaining workers on these Winter space and take the corresponding actions. Let’s take a look at each of these action spaces and how they work:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As previously mentioned, Winter Visitors can assist with the various jobs and tasks during the Winter season. A player that sends a worker to this space can play 1 Winter Visitor card (or 2 if using the bonus space).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to convert grapes to wine, grapes must first be harvested from a player’s fields and placed into his crush pads near the bottom left portion of his player. Players can send workers to this action space to harvest grapes from one of their fields (from 2 different fields is using the bonus space). When choosing a field to harvest, the values of the red and white grapes are added together separately, and then these values are recorded on the Crush Pad space. There are at set of Crush Pads for red grapes, as well as a set for white grapes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For instance, Player B decides to harvest grapes from his 1st field on his player board. The set of Vine cards planted here will total a Red grape valued at 4 and a White grape valued at 2. Therefore, he would place markers below on the #4 space on his Crush Pad for red grapes, and on the #2 space on his Crush Pad for white grapes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once grapes have been placed in the Crush Pad, they can be converted into wine and bottled in the player’s Cellars. A workers can be sent to this action space in order to make up to 2 bottles of wine (an additional bottle if using the bonus space). When doing this, players will take markers from their Crush Pads and place them into their Cellar. There are four types of wine in the game, and each are made using different combinations of red and white grapes from the Crush Pad.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- In order to make a Red wine, the player simply moves one of his markers on his red grape crush pad and places it on the matching red value space in the Cellar. Therefore to make a Red Wine with a value of 4, he would need a marker on the #4 space of his red crush pad.

- White wine is made in the same way, except that the marker is taking from the white crush pad and placed on the matching white wine cellar space.

- Blush wines are made by adding a Red grape and a White grape from the crush pads together. Their values are totaled, and the added total represents the new value of the Blush wine. For instance, a player can take a #3 red grape from his red crush pad and a #5 white grape from his white crush pad, add them together, and create a Blush Wine with a value of 8. Blush Wines can be made once the player has at least built a medium Cellar.

- Sparkling wines are made by adding two red grapes and a white grape together. The totaled value of all three of these grapes from the crush pads equals the new value of the bottled Sparkling Wine. Sparkling Wine can only be made if a player has constructed a large Cellar.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Merchants and restaurant owners will place wine orders to the local vineyard. These orders are kept in the purple-colored draw deck on the top of the game board. When sending a worker to this action space, the player will be allowed to draw 1 Wine Order card from the draw deck (draw 2 if using the bonus space). Each Wine Order card references the types and values of wine needed to fulfill the Wine Order, as well as the awarded Victory Points and any residual payments accumulated for completing it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When a residual payment is earned, the player will increase their bottle marker on the residual track (seen above). The maximum payment a player can ever receive year to year is 5 lira. Taking a look at the card below, we can see that the Wine Order asks for a Red wine valued at 3 and a Blush wine valued at 7. For fulfilling this Wine Order the player would receive 5 Victory Points and increase his yearly residual payments by 2.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once a player has obtained a wine order and bottled the types of wine and values required, he can send a worker to this action space to fulfill the wine order (he’ll gain an additional Victory Point if using the bonus space). When completing the card, players will remove wine tokens from their cellar that match the listed types and have values at least equal the requested values on the wine order. Wine Orders provide the largest amount of Victory Points in the game, and is a vital path to winning the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As your vineyard continues to grow from season to season, you will have the chance to add more workers to your labor force. By sending a worker to this action space, players can pay 4 lira and start the training of a new worker (they will gain 1 lira back if taking the bonus space). Since the worker is in training, he can not be used during this Winter season. He will be available beginning with the following Summer season.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before the next Spring phase begins, there are a few items at the end of the Winter phase that need special attention. Make sure that the following steps are taken before beginning a new Round:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
End-Game Conditions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As mentioned before, players continue the game until someone reaches 20 Victory Points. Note that when a player reaches 20 Victory Points, play continues until the Round is over. Therefore it is possible that a player reaches 20 Victory Points in the Summer season, but still lose the game if another player finished with 22 by the end of the Winter season.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thoughts

The word “viticulture” is defined as the cultivation of grapevines; grape-growing. It is only fitting then that Viticulture is designed in a way to walk players through a sort of engine-building experience of the wine-making process. Thematically, much like with Euphoria, the theme is interwoven within the mechanics of the game to help bring players into the world itself. Players will take the various steps of making wine, from the planting of the vines, to the harvest, to crushing the grapes, bottling the wine, and ultimately selling it to merchants. As each year passes, it only makes sense that the bottled wine would age, and when doing so would become more valuable. This is a thematic mechanic also included in the game. Also, different jobs need to be done depending on the season of the year. It would thematically make sense then that you wouldn’t harvest grapes in the same season you planted the vines. Each season feels completely different from one another, and even in the two seasons where players send workers out to perform the various actions on the board, the summer actions for the most part are far different than the winter ones.

It’s this unique splitting of the two worker placements seasons that really helps Viticulture stand apart from others within its genre. Players only have so many workers at their disposal, and players must decide at the beginning of the year which tasks they need to complete between the summer and winter seasons. The more summer tasks they complete, the less workers they’ll have available for the winter, and vice versa. I did find it interesting that while players can block other players from certain actions spaces, there are two built-in elements that keep this from being too much of a problem. For one, almost all of the actions spaces in both the summer and winter seasons are very useful. There are times when you find that you are blocked from an action area that you had planned on using, only to find that by taking an alternative action, the reward is almost just as good. This is true especially with the Visitor cards. It wasn’t until a few playthroughs when I realized just how powerful these Visitors can be. They usually contain actions that are much more powerful than the actions spaces themselves, and should not be ignored.

The other element that minimizes the aspect of blocking is the Grande worker. I have to admit that I was a bit hesitant with a worker than can be placed anywhere in a worker placement game, but by the end of the first game it made complete sense, and only added to the overall strategy. Remember than each player only has 1 Grande worker to be used each year. Therefore, players must decide which of the 12 action spaces they’ll want to save their Grande worker for just in case opposing players block that space. It helps to open up the game a bit, but without derailing any of the strategy. As a side note, it is interesting that Euphoria also uses a mechanic to minimize blocking, while not affecting strategy. It’ll be interesting to see if this is a common design element going forward with future Stonemaier titles.

The main takeaway I have for Viticulture is this. Fulfilling wine orders in the game is, well fulfilling. After spending time planting your fields, building structures to help improve the vineyard, harvesting the grapes, crushing the grapes, bottling the wine, and completing an order, you truly feel a sense of accomplishment. The game creates an atmosphere in which you may know nothing about the wine-making process going in, but you sure do feel like an accomplished viticulturist by the end. That in itself makes the game a successful one. Viticulture being a unique, mechanically well designed worker placement game on top of that, only adds to this game’s excellence.

Hello there

I am thinking of sleeving the cards, but I haven't opened the box yet and am unsure of the following:

1) Qty of cards
2) What the size of the cards are in millimeters (mm)

Many thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, Viticulture contains 118 cards at the 44 x 67 mm size (they're all the same size). There's one incorrect card in the box that can be thrown away--it's the Merchant card in shrink wrap (to be replaced by the Merchant card floating around near the top of the box, which we printed correctly and slipped in the box right before shipping it).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And each card is 0.34 mm thick, so that's about 118,274 cubic millimeters worth of card stock right there. But, as the cards are still in the box - which is approx. 273 x 221 x 103 mm - the relevant size is closer to 6,21 million cubic millimeters, or 6.21 liters. Good luck asking for that kind of sleeve in your FLGS!

P.S.: Open the box! You deserve it.

Hello,

I am intrigued by this game and I see some good prices for Black Friday. I know that a solo version will be included in the Tuscany expansion but am curious if this is the type of game that can be played alone playing multiple sides? Is there any hidden information that would prevent that?

Thanks!

Jonathan
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each player has a hand of various types of cards. Unless you're the kind of solo player that can easily pretend to be multiple people (and forget about what the 'other players' know), I wouldn't recommend plain Viticulture for solo play. It plays well with just two players, though.

Edit: Oh, I forgot! You can try Automa (the solo expansion from Tuscany) on this website. I suggest using your smartphone to access the site while you're playing. It probably won't stay live indefinitely, but for the time being you can in fact play Viticulture solo without owning a physical copy of Tuscany.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The cards another player has are hidden, but knowing what cards another player has would only rarely affect your strategy anyhow (perhaps at the very end of the game). Most of the interaction is a competition for spaces, not countering cards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan: You could just use Automa playtest PnP to let you play Viticulture solo. It's available here: https://app.box.com/s/lfixp0gttqlthlgo5721
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wow! Thanks for the link! I am going to download the rules tonight and make a decision soon. In the meantime, do you guys think this game is worth purchasing just for solo play?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This game is one of my two "10"s in rating, but I would not buy it just for solo play.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Has anyone tried using the Automa variant with the base game? I just picked this one up, and I like to try to give te gsme s play-through solo to get a handle on how it works before trying to teach it to others. If I have to, I'll just play as two players like Rahdo does in his videos, but this solo system looks like it may work alot better.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adrian: Yep, Automa is meant to simulate another player. It can be played with Viticulture by itself, though Morten recommends including at least one Tuscany expansion--it's really hard with just Viticulture.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the goal is just to learn the game playing with just the base game is fine, but if you want a reasonable chance to win you should lower the number of victory points, the Automa gets, and I think it'll get samey after some games without the Mamas and Papas expansion to vary the starting situation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the 2 player game there is no way to get a bonus on any placement, correct? Thought the grande worker could allow you to take the bonus if it was the first placed in the 2 player game .... Why is this no longer the case???
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen: Lots of question marks at the end of your question there--just one will do.

You're referring to the old version of the grande worker, which had two abilities. We've simplified the grande worker in adding it to the second edition of the game, so his only extra ability (other than being used as a regular worker) is to be placed on an action that is already full. The bonus ability you're referring to is now on a different special worker called the Farmer in Tuscany's special worker expansion.

Thus you're correct--in a 2-player game, the bonuses are not accessible. However, things change on the extended game board in Tuscany.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unofficial way to reintroduce bonuses in 2-player Viticulture (inspired by Automa solo variant):

Place one glass bead next to each bonus space in the spring track.

Each time you place your rooster on a space that still has a glass bead, take it.

You can use this as a bonus for any taken action later in the year.

I find this a quite simple way of keeping bonuses in two-player games. Not sure if it throws the balance off, though.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was dropping by here to mention the solo variant rule, but I can see that I got ninja'd .

I didn't test the rule out in the two player game, but I felt that it added some nice strategic choices to the solo game without unbalancing the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Jamey I will try to keep my question mark usage to an acceptable,level Do you think the use of bonuses as outlined above would unbalance the 2player game? Thanks. Steve
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you do not place a bonus bead by the #1 wake-up slot, there would be six bonus tokens available, and each of the two players would likely want to make sure they received three of them. I can see that altering strategy (if you normally try and get two wine orders in the first two years, for example, you could be giving up a point by bonus point by doing that), but that's not necessarily a bad thing. If you let your opponent take 5 bonuses to your 1, that would be unbalanced.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, this variant would work just fine in a 2-player game. Thanks for the suggestion!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And using the Grande either to get an action in a already taken location OR to get a bonus in an unused location how would that be? I'm hoping to get my wife to,play this so I want to make sure the 2 player game is as interesting as it can be. Thanks again
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was not hugely unbalanced. However, if the goal is to get you wife to play other games, it would be a harder rule to unlearn than simply putting bonus beads on the wake-up track.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen: The grande only has one ability now (that's important to remember, because it won't work with Tuscany if the Grande has both abilities). With this variant, you can discard a glass token whenever you place any worker (regular or grande) to get the bonus associated with the action that worker has taken.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for that. Do you have to spend the bonus glass bead the turn you pick it up or can you save them up?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They're a resource you can save until you're ready to use them, and you can have as many as you'd like saved up.

Check out the Automa rules here and it'll make more sense (click on the link for the English rules): http://stonemaiergames.com/rules-2/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many thanks Jamey you're a gent
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have played the 2 player game a few times using the glass token setup similar to the Automa rules and it works good in a 2 player game. We have played the rule that a glass token can be used as a one time claim of any of the off limits bonus spaces. They can be saved up to be used in any season and in any year.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This idea of using the glass tokens as bonuses (cf automa rules) fixes my issue with 2 players as well: in spring we always choose either position 6 (1VP) or position 7 (grey worker). With the tokens in place, the other spots become more attractive now!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We just tried a variant where we allowed two spaces to be used on the play summer visitor and winter visitor actions. However, we didn’t allow the bonuses to be used on them. It worked well and allowed both players to get an engine going by playing cards.

Didn’t look at the clock but guessing this shortened the game length somewhat as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1270808:
I've played it 3 times, but I'm still unsure.

Some people have complaints about visitor cards, because you can have very good or very bad ones for that moment in the game.

However I would think rather that the problem is the synergy between vine and order cards. How could you win if you get only red vines and white orders?

Thank you!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quite a bit, but it all evens out in most cases. The chaos inherent in a 4-6 player game is the dominant factor.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for your question, Paulo. Let's talk percentages--Dave, I appreciate your comment, but "quite a bit" could be a bit misleading, as players have control over most of their decisions in Viticulture, with the cards being the only element of luck in the game. I would say the game is 85% skill and 15% luck--a skilled player will win every time over a lucky player.

The key, Paulo, is that you have control over how many cards you draw and when you draw them. Sometimes players will feel unlucky if they plant a bunch of vines, harvest them into, say, red and white wine, and then wait until late in the game to pick up any wine orders, which end up having blush wine on them. But that's not really unlucky--that's a sign that those players should have picked up wine orders a lot earlier in the game. Sure, it is remotely possible that you could only draw white vine cards and only draw red wine order cards, but the chances are extremely slim. In fact, in the original game every player starts out with a pinot vine card in hand, which produces 1 red and 1 white grape, so that situation I just described isn't even possible. It becomes possible in Tuscany, but the extended board adds two key actions that eliminate the possibility.

As for the visitor cards, they're the one truly random part of the game that you don't have much control over. You can build a cottage to draw more of them, but it's possible they'll have nothing to do with what you want to do, while other players draw cards that fit their strategies well. It's possible, albeit unlikely. You might also start the game with a visitor card that does nothing until Year 5, which might feel unlucky, but it also gives you something to plan ahead for. The only truly unlucky aspect of the original visitor cards (some of them) is that there are a few that are only good early in the game. So if you draw one of them late in the game, it's unlucky. Again, we fix that in Tuscany, but that element of luck is in the game.

Overall, Viticulture is a game of choices, not luck.

My wife and i enjoy this game alot. We are having 4 friends over and she suggested this game. Now we have played lords of waterdeep a number of times with 6 and have enjoyed it. So teaching and stuff shouldn't be a big deal.

But more speaking to those who have played it with 6. Is it good? Or does it drag? Or is it balanced with turn order possible issues? Since presumably each player only gets one shot at first player.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I played it once with 6. I think the game was still well-balanced, but it did take quite a while to finish. It was fine, since I was spending time with friends. Understand that this will likely be the only game you play that evening.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll second that. The game is still tight and plays well, but it does take a while to get through. While I never timed our 6-player games, I estimate we might have spent 2+ hrs (including rules explanation for newcomers).

Does it overstay its welcome? Not for me, at least. As you already know, tension builds as the game gets near the end, so that helps keep me interested. I'd compare it to a five-course dinner: Everything, including the dessert, is great, but afterwards you do feel very full.

Now, if your guests expect a somewhat light-ish game, then they might feel that 6-player Viticulture is quite a mouthful. It feels tight for most of the game, so you have to be on top of things for the full duration. On the other hand, Viticulture has a fair bit of luck, and if luck doesn't favor you in a 2 hr game you might feel a bit cheated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Going first is less important with 6 players. The advantages to getting the extra visitor, point, or worker should not be underestimated. Good players sometimes never bother to go first.

The game will only drag if players have some form of analysis paralysis, but it will take a while to play.

In some ways, the 6-player game feels looser than the two-player game, thanks to the bonus spaces.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We played with six last night. Four new to the game. The designer claiming that it should not take much longer with 6 than 2 (he claims 90 minutes!) is just crazy talk.

The rules explanation took 20-30 minutes and then the game itself took another 3.5 hours. We played with some components of the Tuscany expansion that might have slowed things down a little bit, if only for having to explain a few extra rules. Some players of course played a bit slower than others, but everyone still played at a decent clip. The lengthy time took us by surprise, especially given the designer's contrary claim, and we lost one player towards the end who simply could not stay longer.

This was my first play of Viticulture and I think that overall it is a good game, but it drags way too much with six. It is most likely a much better game with 3-4 players (if I had to guess).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beeginner games take longer generally. When I first was learning the game, it wass not unusual for a 6-player game to take 3+ hours, but now they are rarely as long as two. There are so many decisions, it's hard to see an optimal path for your posiftkon until you learn the game,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My group plays Viticulture regularly and almost always with 6 players. When we started, the first game took about 3 hours including rule teaching and was soon thereafter at 2 hours. Nowadays (maybe 50 games played), it only takes us about 90 minutes.

We use a first edition set with 2nd edition rules.
Games usually end in year 6 (or 7). Twice it could have ended in year 5 but the leading player didn't plan it quite right, so we never have been that fast.

I would argue that first player is MORE important when there are more players in the game, but as stated above good planning early can often overcome wakeup order positioning.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first time I played Viticulture was with six players. No one had played it before with only one person who had done a dry run and knew the rules. We clocked in at a little over two hours (not including rules explanation which I didn't clock).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Six first-timers playing Viticulture in just over two hours? Now I have played my fair share of board games over many years with a large number of different people (fast, slow and in-between), but you can color me amazed. I believe your claim is doable, but not for a second do I believe that your claim is the norm.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just sharing my experience. I haven't played Viticulture with enough unique play groups to know if this is the norm or not.

Hilo ID 1267313:
In somewhere between a third and half the games I play, I try for a strategy where I aim to make most of my points on the various bonuses (going sixth, tasting room, windmill, selling grapes, etc.), and I can reliably score over 20 in seven years. Usually, I'm playing against TalkieToaster (among others), which means the game will rarely last past six years.

Saturday, I start off choosing my start last in a 6-player game, and my starting summer visitor is the wedding planner (I need to give two coins to each other player, and get one point for each other player). When the only two selections left were to go first or to take the point, I decided to take the point. By time it became my turn to move, the +1 bonus for the tour was still open (three players built their trellis the normal way, and one use the Uncertified Architect to build a trellis and a yoke the first turn), so I decide the bonus strategy would be viable. I took the tour, used my Grande to build the tasting room, and took another tour.

In the second year, I built another worker, I finally built a trellis, planted, and harvested in year 3, and added another worker and more grapes in year 4. Since I was taking summer visitor, I leveraged the Peddler and the Auctioneer into 2 points, and got a boost from the Buyer. I also built a windmill in year 5. In years 5 and 6, I used all 5 workers in the summer (there was very little competition for the spaces).

Points tally:
Bonus point for going 6th: 6 points
Tasting room bonus: 6 points
Selling grapes space: 3 points
Auctioneer: 2 points
Buyer: 1 point
Windmill: 1 point
Wedding planner: 5 points
Edit
Morale down to 0: -1 point.

Somehow, that adds up to 24, so we must have missed scoring one of my points along the way!

As usual, TalkieToaster also passed 20 in year six, but only managed 21.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well done! It's rare that you can win Viticulture without making wine, but as you've proved, it is possible (though I'm a little surprised that no one else took the bonus point for going 6th). In our Tuscany rulebook, we actually make a point of saying that the game is more than just about making wine--it's about having the most successful vineyard in Tuscany. With you hosting weddings, tastings, selling grapes, and offering your workers the pleasure of waking up late, it sounds like you had a very successful vineyard!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A very well played and fun game! The Wedding card the last year was an amazing play! I hope that Tuscany does not make this strategy more difficult. Either way, it will be fun to find more "corner cases" like this in Tuscany!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With the game now going to 25 on the new board, I think it will help wine-making a little more over increment accumulation. It will be interesting to see.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
True, but there's also the new market action space where you can buy victory points with money. We did playtest that particular strategy a few times to see if players could win that way (i.e., without making wine), and you can definitely score a lot of points, but other players can leap forward in the end with some good wine production.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's what seems to happen most of the time I try this strategy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Wedding Planner is a promo card, so most of us will not have that in our game. Do you think you would have had the same outcome without the promo card?

Interesting note the pic for Viticulture: Kickstarter Promotional Cards Image section has a pic of a card that says Wedding Party on its card.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for the correction on the card name.

The Wedding Party was originally a Kickstarter exclusive, and Jamey later made it standard widely available, with the permission of the Kickstarter funders.

The Wedding Party will be included in all the Viticulture 2.0 games. If you have the retail version of Viticulture 1.0, you can get it (and the other three Kickstarter cards) as a part of the Viticulture update pack. You do not need to buy Tuscany for this, and the card is not included as a part of Tuscany.

I probably would have gone a different way in the game if I did not have the Wedding Party. I may have followed a path where many/most of my points came from bonuses, but would have sought to make a wine or two, as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric: Just to clarify, the wedding planner is in Tuscany (it's still in the Arboriculture expansion, though it could be "unlocked" earlier). It's not in the base game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My apologies. I'll remember if there is a next time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nice result Eric! Under the new rules of the Essential Edition of Viticulture, using the Tasting Room now requires you to have a wine token in your cellar.

Judging by responses in the thread referenced below, it's not the most popular change:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In one of my winery trips, they gave us tastings of wine as it was being run through the filter. Hadn't gotten close to the cellar for aging.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, a new member of BGG here from Indonesia! Sorry for the long post.

My wife and I are fans of Viticulture (and others with elegant theme/art). We bought our VEE 2 months ago, but did not play it often because our jobs.

Nevertheless, I tried to play it twice with my friend, who is a devout gamer and very proficient in worker placement games (he was the top rank of our shop for such games like Lorenzo, Lords of Waterdeep, Gallerist, etc).

In the first game, which was a 4-player game, I tried to take VPs in "normal" way, and ended the game 1 point short from him (22 vs 21). I think it was because my friend was very efficient and this game did not stray too far from his similar game.

In the second game, which was a 6-player game (with other routine gamers), I tried to look for "no-win(e) strategy" if possible, simply because I knew I would not be on par with these guys in term of efficiency and it would be tight competition for wine-making spots (I was proud to be more an all-rounder vs them; hardcore worker-placement types). But I was ready to make plant-harvest engine, too, if I was blocked early. I won in 5 years.
Please keep in mind, what I mean with "no-win(e)" is not making 0 wine/filling 0 order, but rather is making minimum number of wine/filling 1/2 orders just to fuel your point-pinching strategy (not engine-building).
These were my turns:

Papa-Mama: 2 green-1 yellow + forget how much Lira
Year 1 - 2 VP
Get 1 VP in waking order
1. Sell 7 value field for 1 VP
2. Build Trellis
3. Train a new worker

Year 2 - 1 VP
Get 1 VP in waking order
1. Play Sharecropper - plant a 2-value red in 5-value field/Syirah (+draw Yellow = Patron)
2. Plant in 5-value field (plant a 2-value white/Trebbiano)
3. Harvest - get 2 wh/2 r grapes
4. Play Caravan to get Yellow and Blue
Grapes were aged to 3wh/3r

Year 3 - 4 VP
Get 1 VP in waking order
1. Play Importer - get 3 Blue
2. Build Yoke
3. Play Patron - draw Purple and Blue - I got 5 white for 2 VP order
4. Play Guest Speaker - get new worker and 3 VP from 3 other players
Grapes were aged to 4wh/4r; around this time I realize I could win with "no-win(e) strategy", so I pursued it more with cards drawing

Year 4 - 1 VP
Get 1 VP in waking order
1. Play Importer - get 3 Blue
2. Play Peddler - get 1/1/1/1 Green/Yellow/Purple/Blue
3. Build Cottage - to increase my chance at visitor cards
4. Harvest from Yoke - get a new pair of 2 wh/2r grapes
5. Play Zymologist - make 4wh/4r wines
Grapes were aged to 5 wh/5r and 3 wh/3r
In this stage, because I had Broker, Horticulturist, and Governess, I was almost sure I could get to 20 VP, the question was whether I could get the last 1 VP in bonus Fill Order spot because I'm not the first player in Spring. I discarded my other Purple and other unsignificant cards.

Year 5 - 12 VP
The player on my right took 2nd waking order (YEAY!)
First player

1. Sell 6 value field for 1 VP
2. Play Broker - 3 VP
3. Play Horticulturist - 3 VP
4. Fill Order - 5 value white wine for 2 VP + 1 VP bonus spot
Other players kept harvesting, playing Blue, and making wine token
5. Play Governess with Grande - discard 5 value red wine for 2 VP

My friend came second with his Motivator play (wine order+3 VP for total of 16 VP, he had gotten a few VPs already from Swindler, that card is so overpowered in 5-6 player games = played in the second year = 5 instant VPs)

Yes, I might get a good set of cards, but in that game I just played with dealt hands and tried to adjust my strategy according what I got/drew (and increasing my chance though any means). Maybe if I played with other "no-win(e) strategy" player, I would hasten my planting engine and took many small orders for bonus 1 VP spot. It would pressure my opponent because "no-win(e) strategy" is not so forgiving if you misplayed your turns.

So in conclusion, I think I can agree with above opinion that Viticulture doesn't have a set ways to win. Precisely because of the luck involved card draws, you have to be always on your feet planning your next move to beat your opponent.

TL DR: It is a RACE game, not your usual worker placement game, and you have to be ready to change your plan according to the situation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What a well-played game!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey, i can't see cellar building in your turn history, so how were you able to age those wines beyond value 3?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Zymologist, most likely.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wines were value 4 before the Zymologist was played. Perhaps that was the Papa bonus?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He said:
Play Zymologist - make 4wh/4r wines

The confusing part for me was playing the Importer twice.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the end of year 4 - after playing zymologist - the wines aged to value 5.
I'm still suspicious.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They are supposed to. In fact, they could have aged to 6 (within that cellar level), but not 7 (until the large cellar is built). This has been ruled on several times.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm shocked that everytime people asks about Residual Payment track, they don't ask this:

- If you already gets to the 5, do you stop there forever?

I mean, I've already understood that you receive only up to 5 liras at the end of the year. I want to know whether, after getting to 5, I must go to 2 if I fill an order with a "2". So I could earn 5 in some year, and then only 2 in the next one.

I read the rules, the faq, several topics here, I've searched and I did not find this!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paulo: Thanks for your question. The rules (at least, the second edition rules) do say: "The highest residual payment a player can receive is 5 lira, even if they fill additional wine orders."

So yes, it doesn't explicitly say that you the residual track doesn't reset after you reach 5 and fill another wine order, but it's insinuated that while filling more wine orders would typically make you earn a higher residual, the highest you can receive is 5 lira. Similarly, the rules explicitly say that you don't have to do 9 jumping jacks every time you create a 9-value sparkling wine, but it's not required to do so.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1261000:
We had just one question after our first playthrough today.

For example if we crush a red 5 grape and a white 2 grape into a blush wine but we don't have a large cellar,does it a) become a blush 6 wine, or is this b) forbidden by absence of the large cellar?
Can we crush a lvl 9 grape into a lvl 6 wine by absence of the large cellar?

We went with a) as we also crushed lvl 9 grapes into blush/sparkle which became wine of value over the possible values of the large cellar.

Unless I missed it, it wasn't really stated in the rules.


Even so we really enjoyed it. We had a runaway leader with like 10 points ahead, who eventually lost the game when we started to fill our orders
The only thing that bothered me, was the uselessness of money towards the end.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Any wine made that can't fit a space due to the cellar not being large enough, or a wine token already on that space is 'devalued' to the largest space it can be placed. Therefore in your example it's a Blush 6 wine token.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, it's not spelled out in the rules, but I agree with your interpretation: Whenever you make a wine that has higher value than your cellar can hold, you put it in the next available space. (This is in fact demonstrated for a level 4 Red Wine in Example 1 on page 11 of the revised rules.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
comes with an expansion or two that should alleviate that. In the mean time, consider buying an additional worker or two, then a yoke, and then a wind mill. Use the worker(s) to uproot and plant new vines. The wind mill will provide you with 1 VP every time you do this.
Alternatively, some of the Visitor cards allow you to trade Lire for VPs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As we thought. Just now I noticed "Note 3" in the rules

"Each wine icon on the cellar can fit exactly 1 wine token. This follows the same rules as explanced in Note 2 in the Harvest section". That explains it too, as does example 1 ;-)

Thx!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I believe Rodney's Watch it Played rules video specifically addressed this... that you degrade until it fits.

Are you using the 2nd edition rules? My guess is that this circumstance is spelled out there.

Edit: Yep, found it. Explanation is at 15:30
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for your question, Dirk, and I appreciate everyone chiming in. I'm here if it's still not clear. And yes, as Holger points out, we directly address the money issue (too tight in the beginning, too useless at the end) in Tuscany in several different ways.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't think they can make it any clearer at this point
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As you get more experience with the game, you will probably see the game years lessen (our games usually don't last more than 7 years), and there is little time for money to build up. Also, I think money is a tie-breaker.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Money is indeed the first tiebreaker. Thanks Eric!

I see that the 2nd edition of Viticulture comes with 50 of the smaller glass tokens, while the upgrade pack contains only 30 of them.

Is there any reason for the reduced number in the upgrade pack, and will it be sufficient?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, the 30 tokens in the update pack are meant to accent the original tokens, not completely replace them (remember that we gave the update pack to Tuscany backers for free if they already owned Viticulture). If you have a mix of the big and small tokens, they'll fit fine on the mat.

Also, Tuscany includes 18 more tokens in the new size.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was going to remove all the large tokens from the game and just replace them with the smaller tokens, but I guess that's a bad idea, and I'll need to keep some of the original tokens in the game too. Thanks for clarifying that, Jamey.

I just got my copy of Viticulture and in the box was a loose "merchant" winter visitor card (dark blue back). However, it got mixed in with the other winter visitor cards before I discovered that there was another merchant card; that the loose one was intended to correct a misprint. Unfortunately I don't know for sure which one is the correct version. I think I know, (the card whose text has the addition "/or" is the correct version) but can someone confirm my thinking?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CJ: Thanks for your question. One of the cards is grammatically incorrect and could cause some confusion. We caught it after the cards had already been printed, but the games were still at the factory, so we quickly had Panda print the correct card and slip it into the top of the game. The correct card is shown here.

Ah, I was wondering what that was for. It shows again what a great company Jamey runs.

Received my copy of the 2nd edition this morning.. lovely fat little box n great insert. Looking forward to making some wine tonight.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We got ours on Friday and had a good time with two games over the weekend. One thing we did mess up was removing the vine cards once they were harvested, so that made starting any kind of engine pretty tough. Have fun!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks.. will keep that in mind so it doesn't happen to me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mine's supposed to arrive tomorrow! It will get a head start before I get Tuscany.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am def. getting Tuscany... I like how much variety it adds to the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adam: That's a big rule! We went out of our way to highlight that rule in the second edition because a lot of people did that by accident with the first edition, and it makes a huge impact on the game. The idea is that you're planting the vines (cards) in the fields, so when it comes time to harvest, you don't actually tear the vines out of the fields--you simply pluck grapes (tokens) off of them to put on your crush pad.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glad to see you emphasized this. I have first edition from KS and played it making that same mistake first two games!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roland: Hopefully it's more clear now. It's in bold on both the winter action overview page and on the next page about harvesting. I also made sure that Rodney emphasized it in the Watch It Played rules video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fcDctkFFE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So no shipping notices getting sent out then?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Emphasize, make it bold, whatever you want, and even repeat it 3 times at the table while you're setting up and my wif... errr, I mean someone, will still forget the rule while they're playing. I speak from personal experience.

Magic Pink: Amazon fulfillment sends out shipping notices to all recipients. If you're supposed to be getting Viticulture early (this is different than the Tuscany shipment), you should have already gotten your shipping notice from Amazon (or the notice might be in your spam folder). What's your Kickstarter name? I could look up your order for you right now.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Murr: I've found it best to explain it thematically like I did for Adam above. Perhaps that'll help?

What about the EU backers, as they will be handled by Ideaspatcher?

Thx Jamey for the time you take to follow up this forum
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dirk: From my correspondence with them over the last few days, Ideaspatcher decided to wait until after Essen Spiel to send out Viticulture to backers. They didn't go out today, but they've assured me that they'll finally go out tomorrow. I'm really sorry about the delay, and they've assured me in the future that it won't take this long (they received the games back on October 8).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Np, it's beyond your control.
We've waited so long, a few more days don't matter
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So... did you get it ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No I have the collector's edition Tuscany/Viticulture thingamabob. I didn't know there had been another KS.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cool!
I will have to wait until December-January for my Collector's edition.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey Oscar... yeah man, awesome little box.. looks really nice and the components are really good. Tuscany looks excellent too.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's probably waiting for me with the rest of my mail. Unfortunately, I'm swamped at work and won't be able to break it out before the weekend.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I know how it is.. I gotta leave it for this weekend as well.. I don't know how to fully play it yet. Did take it out last night to set it up and read the rules.. looks awesome.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Magic Pink: There is no other KS. If you take a look at the project page or project updates, you'll see that there was the option to buy Viticulture separately from Tuscany to receive it earlier than the Tuscany shipments (Tuscany, Tuscany Prima, Tuscany/Viticulture combo, or Collector's Edition), all of which are due to arrive in December or January. I've been keeping backers up to date about the status of these deliveries through project updates, and I've been trying to be clear about the differences between those shipments. You will indeed get a shipment notification from Amazon when your package has shipped from Amazon fulfillment in a few months.

Hello,

Can someone help me to understand how the mood track works at the end of the year ? You take points -/+ 1 at every end of the year?

Hi Andrei, thanks for your question. I'm trying to figure out what the "mood track" is. There's a residual track at the bottom right of the board that gives you money at the end of the year. And there's a wake-up chart on the far left that gives you a bonus at the beginning of the year. But there is no mood track.

I think he's talking about the track on the Aboriculture expansion board.

If I remove my trellis, do I lose the vines that require it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nope! You only check for structure requirements when planting vines. If the structure is torn down, the vines stick around.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Steven, that is correct. Francis, I think you're referring to the Handyman card, which is one of the fully errataed cards because of the confusing issue it presented (per your question). This card and the others that follow are correct in the second edition, and an update pack is available for purchase through our website.

Entertainer: Pay $4 to draw 3 winter visitor cards OR discard 1 wine token and 3 visitor cards to gain 3 VP.

Handyman: All players may build 1 structure at a $2 discount. You gain 1 VP for each other player who does this.

Horticulturist: Plant any 1 vine even if you don’t have the structure(s) required OR uproot and discard 2 vine cards to gain 3 VP.

Yeah yeah, I got it: I'm buying a 2nd edition as soon as it's out.

(We're currently playing with a first edition a friend received in a trade.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ha ha...sounds good. But the update pack is much cheaper than the full game if you just want that part of it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks. But considering I don't own the game at all (and would like a copy of my own), I believe my enjoyment would be greatly enhanced by a full complement of components.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am personally glad the Handyman has been given a new power with the second edition. The number of times I've had to say 'you need to build the medium cellar before the large cellar' because of that card is more than just once or twice. I'm so looking forward to my copy of the KS collector's edition before the year is out.

1. If you play your Grande Worker on a bonus action space (i.e. you're NOT using your Grande Worker on a full action), do you get the bonus?

2. If you play your Grande Worker on an action space (whether with a bonus or not), the Grande *does* occupy the space, right?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you play the Grande worker on any action space, it acts exactly like a regular worker. The only time a Grande worker is different is when there is no action space available on the action you wish to choose.

1. I'm not sure what the question is, but if you play a Grande worker on a bonus space, you get to use both the action and the bonus, just like with a regular worker.

2. If you place the Grande worker on any action space, it prevents any other worker from using that action space.

Viticulture: The Strategic Game of Winemaking is a worker placement board game set in a rustic Tuscany community. You’ll make the decisions as to what kind of winery you’ll become as your vineyard grows. Will you work to create high end lucrative bottles that take a long time to perfect? Or will you setup a winery that caters to visitors and the power that comes with name recognition? Maybe you’d prefer to farm and sell your grapes without having to deal with the production side of wine. All options are on the table as you become the winemaker you’ve always wanted to, from the comfort of your dining room table.

Viticulture Game Play

In Viticulture, your goal is to earn victory points, the player with the most victory points after someone reaches 20, wins. You earn victory points several different ways; giving vineyard tours, selling grapes, planting vines, but the biggest bang comes by filling wine orders. This is what you will spend most of the game working towards. In order to fill orders you need to crush grapes into wine. In order to crush, you need grapes. To get grapes you must plant vines, and in order to plant vines you may or may not need things like trellises or irrigation systems. As you can see, you will have to put in a lot of work before you start reaping the benefits of your winery (just as it would in real life). To get all this work done you have a small number of workers available to you, and your job is to manage those workers and what they are doing to reach your end goal. Of course, everyone playing the game has workers too, and the space available for those workers is limited, so you have to keep an eye on what your opponents are doing and factor that into your decision making as the game moves along.

Each round of the game takes place over the course of a year in Viticulture with each season acting as a phase in what actions can take place. Here is a breakdown of what happens over a year.

Spring

One of the most difficult things to get used to in the game of Viticulture — but also one of the most interesting — is how turn order is decided. With each new season the owners must decide when they will send their workers out to the fields. They do this by placing their rooster game tokens on the order chart. The cool thing is that with each step back in turn order you get a better reward to aid in your game-play. So depending on what you want to accomplish in any given year you may want to be as close to first as possible, or the ability to add an extra worker to your pool may cause you to hold off till the last spot in placement order. Choose incorrectly and your plans for the year could blow up before you place your first worker.

This mechanic takes some getting used to, but it really adds a great first critical decision to every round that makes it one of many highlights to the game.

Summer

Once turn order has been established, it’s time to move into the summer months. Time for researching vines, building structures, planting vines and entertaining summer visitors. This is where you will first start to place your workers on the board and it leads us to another unique aspect to this game, what I like to call the “First to play” bonus. With each type of work that can be done on the game board the first player to place a worker there receives a bonus for that move. For example, if you choose to build a structure like a tasting room, and you’re the first player to build, you get a discount off the building price. These bonuses are very beneficial and can include adding additional victory points to your overall score which can be the difference maker in winning or losing a game.

Summer continues as long as players wish to keep placing workers on summer action spots. Once everyone has placed all their workers, or made the decision to pass and hold on to remaining workers for the winter phase, summer ends, and fall begins.

Fall

Fall is the shortest season in the game and consists of each player choosing either a summer or winter visitor card. Once each player gets their card in hand we move on to winter.

Winter

The winter months round out the year and lasts until all workers have been played. During the winter, some of the actions players will be able to take include taking customer orders, harvesting grapes, crushing grapes into wines and filling wine orders for victory points.

The winter phase is really when tensions peak in Viticulture. With limited spots to work and a lot of work to do, there never seems to be enough space for the work everyone wants to get done, especially towards the end of the game. Many games include some cursing during the winter months as you take the last spot available when the next person in order wanted to play there. Which of course, is immensely satisfying to do. The year ends with some simple clean-up actions at which point you’re ready start a new year with the beginning of spring.

The Wine Geek Perspective

The question that always seems to come up when I’m talking to people about this game is, “Do I need to know about wine to play the game?” The simple answer is no, not at all. Most of the people I play with don’t even drink wine, but they still enjoy the game and have even requested to play the game on occasion. However, a wine geek playing this game will see some of the following things in the game that the non-geek won’t.

Making wine is more intuitive: When you’re making wine you have to follow a process, just like you would if you were making wine yourself. You have to harvest the fields, you have to crush the grapes into wine, and the wine may need to bottle age to get it where you want it. If you know this going in it’s easier to follow.

Grapes matter, but not like you think: In Viticulture grapes are assigned a value, that value, and color are all that matter. It doesn’t matter if your field is a perfect Super Tuscan blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Syrah, or a wild combo of Trebbiano, Malvasia and Sauvignon Blanc, the results are the same. This isn’t a knock on the game at all, it would be a detriment if you had to pay attention to what the harvested grapes were, but the wine geek in me made me take note of it.

Making sparkling wine will make you happy: In order to make sparking wine you have to blend 2 barrels of red grape must with 1 barrel of white must. Champagne lovers rejoice.

Making blush wines will make you cringe: A blush wine is made by combining 1 barrel of red must with 1 barrel of white….the horror! Again, not a knock at all, just some wine nerd fun.

Bottom Line

If you’re familiar with more modern board games or other worker placement games you will find Viticulture to be a top flight game that will likely end up in your rotation for a long time. If the most complicated game you’ve ever played is Monopoly, you’ll still find Viticulture to be a great game, but it may take you a little longer to learn how to play. Thankfully, there are plenty of tutorials out there that will be of great resource to you if you need help. You’ll also be shocked at how in depth a board game can be.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks so much for the great review, Jeff! I understand the horror of combining two different types of grapes (red and white) to make a blush wine...but mechanically I think it was the best option.

You had a note about how the types of grapes don't matter (other than color) when they get to the crush pad. Originally (like, the very first prototype) each type of grape was turned into a unique type of wine that aged at different rates and into different values. It ended up feeling much more like a spreadsheet than a game, and it was too much to keep track of. We did end up tapping into that mechanism in a small way when designing the Formaggio expansion for Tuscany; I think it works much better there with only 4 types of cheeses compared to 9 different types of grapes/wine.

One little note that might be worth adding is that you can only place each of your workers once per year. You allude to this, but I wanted to make it clear to people who haven't played.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for reading and commenting on the review, Jamey!

Yeah, I can't imagine trying to manage the cellar if you had to keep an eye on the grape varieties. It would really detract from the flow of the game so I'm glad you implemented it the way you did.

Same goes for the blush wines, the way it's implemented totally works and I wouldn't change it. Just having some fun looking at it purely from a wine geek perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just for the record; a blush wine does not mean white zinfandel. There are some terrific roses out there. During the summer months I would reach for a good rose far sooner than I would for much of the popular chardonnay that gets sold.
Bad wine is bad wine. Rose has overlap, but so do all varietals.
No horror at all.

This game is available on Amazon for a pretty awesome price of 40.12. Was wondering what edition of the game this would be. I just purchased it!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's pretty likely the 1st edition, which is awesome anyway (the only thing I suggest you do is to get the 2nd edition rules and mark one of the workers to act as a Grande, as it significantly improves the game; the other material tweaks to the game are not nearly as important). It's a pretty good deal at $40.

In any case, you'll be able to get an update pack for the game with the different materials in the 2nd edition (including the Grande) come November for $12: http://stonemaiergames.com/buy/

I played my first game of Viticulture. One difficulty I had is that I had high-value wine order cards and low value grapes. I managed to fill some orders at the end, but it took quite a while to age my grapes so that I could sell them.

What's the rationale for purchasing grapes from random deck? It seems like you should be able to purchase a grape variety that you want at least within some bounds. For example, I want red grapes, white grapes, etc. Or, be able to specify low value/high value grapes? (If so, maybe the high value grapes cost more?)

Also with wine orders, it seems like you would have some control over whether you can get low or high value orders. That is, you look around the market and see what people want then try to fill those that fit the size of your vineyard.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kent: Thanks for your question. Just to clarify some terminology, there are vine cards you can purchase, and when you plant and harvest vine cards, they stay in your fields as you produce grape tokens that go to your crush pad.

There are a few reasons behind the random nature of those cards. First, it's to encourage players to try new strategies from game to game rather than only do the same thing. Second, it is to limit the amount of information you have to consume while looking at the board. Some people do play with a house rule that lets you see the top three cards of the vine deck. I don't recommend it, but you're welcome to play that way.

In standard Viticulture, all players start with a pinot vine card in hand for the very reason you mention: You need to have the potential to make any type of wine on the wine orders you draw. The key is to harvest your fields early and often so you have the grapes to fill any type of wine order you draw--this is a game of planning, so if you wait for a while to harvest fields or draw wine orders, it will be tough to score points.

We have an interpretation question re: the harvest action with the yoke.

You can always get the dollar, you can can also harvest an unharvested
field in the winter:

1) always
2) if there are still normal harvest slots available.
3) if there are NO harvest slots available.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Always. Once built, the yoke is a new action space you can send a worker to. The state of the Harvest Field spaces is irrelevant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Steven! That's correct.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Further clarification:

Can you use the yoke action in the summer to harvest a field? Thematically it doesn't make sense, but I couldn't find anything in the rules that would prevent it being used like this.

I am flat out amazed at the shipping structure Stonemaier Games managed to put in place for its Tuscany (Viticulture Collector's Ed.) Kickstarter campaign.

As an American living in Hong Kong, I'm used to having all games shipped to the USA, as shipping to HK is prohibitively expensive. Highly ironic when the products I'm buying are probably being produced in a factory less than a couple hundred miles away on the mainland!

Somehow, Stonemaier Games was able to get shipping to HK incredibly cheap, and I'll actually be getting my game faster than most due to its proximity to the factory.

I wish other game companies could figure this out :-).

Thanks a million to Stonemaier Games for this, and congratulations on a successful Kickstarter campaign (which is ending like an hour from the time of this post; If you live outside the USA and are interested at all in this game, consider jumping on the KS campaign if you see this in time!)

Queen games, by the other side, DOES NOT ship to Brazil at all giving lame excuses, and Funforge copied and pasted their behavior at the beginning (but Funforge changed its idea at the end, unfortunately using a courier company which gives no answer when asked about brokerage fees).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan: Oh, I know you weren't saying anything bad about us. I'm just genuinely sorry we can't offer Brazil a better rate yet! You all are so close to us, and yet shipping is so expensive! I'll continue to look for a better solution, and if you ever hear about one, please let me know.

If by "sub-genre" you mean full genre that is "worker placement" than Stone Age is the safer bet. It really depends on what level of complexity you want.

Stone Age is a simpler game and is easier to learn for new players.

However, you probably would be fine getting Viticulture. I'd let the theme be a big deciding factor as well as comfort level with complexity. Viticulture is not incredibly more complex, but it is more complex.

Most likely, you'll grow tired of Stone Age quicker than you will Viticulture. Stone Age does have an expansion, but it's hard to find and is therefore expensive. Viticulture's expansion has many parts and adds a LOT of replay value.

Edit: I'd like to bookend this with a clear statement that I think Viticulture is the better game for me. Jamey summarized it very well when he said that Stone Age is really a tactical game while Viticulture has much more strategy. Based on the limited information the OP presented, I do still think that Stone Age is the safer choice, initially.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tyler, I want to let unbiased people answer your question (thanks Dan), but I feel that I should point out a key distinction between the games that may or may not resonate with you. Stone Age is mostly a tactical game. There isn't a lot of long-term strategy or planning. I really like Stone Age for this because it's super easy to teach, and it's still enjoyable for advanced players upon multiple plays. But for the most part, all you're doing is acquiring resources and turning those resources into buildings.

With Viticulture, there is a lot more long-term planning. The game usually lasts about 7 rounds (years), and by year 2 or 3, if you don't have your end game figured out, you're in trouble. Usually players score most of their points in the final two years. There's an element of order of operations that you have to hone over time--draw vines, plant them, harvest fields, make wine, then fill wine orders. That's 5 steps, and the whole time, your grape and wine tokens are aging. They're not sitting in your resource pile doing nothing like the resources in Stone Age.

I mention that specifically because if you like Stone Age because you don't have to map out a master end-game strategy, there's a decent chance you might not enjoy Viticulture. There are plenty of tactical elements to Viticulture, but the element of planning can be overwhelming to people who are used to lighter worker-placement games.

If you have any questions for me, I'm happy to answer them. Otherwise I'll step back and let people say whatever they'd like about Viticulture. Please be blunt and honest with Tyler--I only want people to spend their hard-earned money on Viticulture if there's a good chance they'll actually enjoy it.

This game came fleetingly onto my radar a while ago, but as soon as I saw the availability (i.e. none) I forgot all about it. I just read the reviwe on Shut Up and Sit Down and it's got me thinking all over again. And then I see that Tuscany is being kickstarted, and I can pledge $79 and get Tuscany AND a copy of Viticulture, free shipping to UK. With today's exchange rate that's £47. That seems to me an unbeleivable deal.

The game hits many of the buttons that the different groups I play in like, the theme appeals, the rules look great, beatiful board and great components. I've never used kickstarter before, but I'm struggling to see a downside here - am I missing something glaringly obvious? Is this how people get sucked into backing scores of projects on KS? At the moment I'm like 'shut up and take my money!!!'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's a good worker placement game, with a nice theme. Some people might not like the swingy-ness of the cards, which can be very powerful if you get the right ones at the right time (or useless if you get the wrong ones at the wrong time).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Obviously the main question is what's the downside of Kickstarter not the game itself.
Sometimes games get released quicker and backers have to wait for them months after everybody else is already playing. Not always the prices and exclusives you get for backing a project are appropriate. You have to do some research before backing a game in Kickstarter, but since Viticulture is pure Kickstarter product, I doubt they will fail with expansion.

Hi there,

I recently watched Rahdo Running through Viticulture and there he mentioned that 'El Heffe' is part of the base-game, although the bigger meeple wasn't included. Can someone confirm this statement?

As we re playing this game tomorrow and i would like to play it as correctly as possible.

Thanx in advance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The piece *was* included in the Kickstarter promo expansion

http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/130655/viticultu...

It quickly became the recommendation of the community to include this piece regardless of if you play with this expansion or not. It is now part of the base game, with some modifications

Full review text here.

Quinns is generally positive ("the game's really very good", "The decisions are finely tuned enough that you’re constantly torn between two decisions, even if it's just picking the space you really want and the space you reckon everybody wants.") but has some harsh words for the custom art ("There’s not a visitor in this game who, in real life, wouldn't have you turning off all the lights and peeking from behind the curtains.") and thinks that the grande workers skew the balance of the game away from being overly constrained to saying "it also means that the single teaspoon of adrenaline the genre had is siphoned out of it."

Final verdict: If you buy games regularly, it's "a fine game, made with love" that you'll probably enjoy, although he does recommend some other games for those who only buy games rarely.

Still, happy to see that they're generally positive on the game, since I missed the first kickstarter. But it also reinforces my desire to see custom art pledges go the way of KS exclusive rewards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamey,

It's difficult for me to give a fair answer to that, both because I know that it's custom art (which is, to me, associated with weird, goofy looking illustrations, and inherently introduces bias on my part) and because there's no basis of comparison (profiles created by the artist without constraint). Attempting to look at it objectively:

The Taster is fine. Kinda smug, which is appropriate. He does feel a bit disconnected from the wine he's holding; it almost seems like someone else is holding it out to him.
The Grower is unremarkable, although she looks like she's scheming something.
The Organizer is really good; I love the use of light, and otherwise the art doesn't appear out of place.
The Sponsor is guest-starring on CSI: Tuscany.

And really, that's kind of why I wish it wasn't a thing: you end up making a few dozen people really happy, and for the other 99% of backers (and all retail buyers) you're at best creating art that's as good as what you'd do anyway, and at worst sticks out to the retail buyer and/or to reviewers who say unkind things about the people you've put in your game.

Everything else that you get to add with Kickstarter makes the game better for all of the backers (and now, everyone); when my Collector's Edition shows up, it'll have little mafioso and merchant meeples, and they'll be cute and memorable. Tuscany will have more content in the box because the campaign is going well, and that'll be fun to dig into.

Meanwhile, the best I can hope for when I put those games on the table is that the people blend in with the rest of the art. Nobody at my table is going to care about who the model was, unless the result is that the cards look funny.

It's a look that can work for Flying Frog; if LNOE looks like a direct-to-video movie starring the director's college friends, that's almost appropriate. I don't know that it works anywhere else. And just like how I don't have to apologize to my friends that their retail copy of Euphoria will never be as cool as mine, I'd like to not have to explain, "Yeah, it's a Kickstarter game, so it looks funny because that's a backer."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I personally find that quite off base as a criticism, although to each his own.

Viticulture has basically two races going on. The first race is the summer race - get money, build buildings, plant vines. This is more prevalent in the early stages of the game. The second race is the winter race - harvest, plant, fill orders, which takes over towards the end.

Each of these races has a multiple step cadence, and you will generally want to do their steps in a particular order - specially for the winter one, as everybody scrounges frantically to get their ducks in a row for profitable orders. Often you'll find yourself locked into an specific course of action - you absolutely need to harvest to have the grapes to make the kind of wine you will use later to fill the order - so having the harvest or make wine step blocked and no way to access the actions is devastating in practice. This was particularly prevalent in 2P games.

So it's not like the Grande is a magic bullet - each "big" scoring action in Viticulture is the result of a long chain of actions. The Grande by itself is not nearly enough to warrant you a free pass to 6VP wine order land, but at least gives you a guarantee that you'll be able to advance one step of the chain without the huge loss of tempo that being stalled for a full season entails. It also allows you to fill a last order during the final winter of the game, which is fairer to the players than having all spaces blocked when their turns come and having to let the wine rot in the cellars.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've been wondering about the Grande in a similar way. If I can always get the action I need, doesn't that really undermine the tension?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I haven't gotten a chance to play, but my understanding is that it isn't "always", it's "once per round." So you can be slowed down significantly, you just can't be completely stopped.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Yeah, it's a Kickstarter game, so it looks funny because that's a backer."

We're definitely not aiming for that--the artist is working with the card abilities as she creates the art to make sure that doesn't happen.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This. I've only ever played with the Grande worker, and the games have never felt like multiplayer solitaire; you only have 1 grande and you'll typically want to save him until you really need him. Besides, whoever gets somewhere first always takes the bonus spot, and those bonuses are usually very good and contested, so there's still a fair amount of blocking. The grande worker just makes you go: 'Aw damn, well now what...?' rather than get that sinking feeling when you realize that once again you will not be able to feed your family (yeah, Agricola, I'm looking at you!).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I mean, I'd assume that you didn't set out to make Viticulture with the goal of, "We want reviews to joke about how weird the visitors look", and yet...

I honestly kinda feel bad continuing to talk about this, because I feel like I'm beating up on you, and I think you're a good guy who makes good games that I support. But as a fan, I also feel like your games are coming out less polished than they should be for the benefit of a few people. It's the same reason I'm happy that you're not making KS exclusive components anymore. I have no desire to make the retail copies less good than my backer copy just because I jumped on the KS; I'd rather everyone have the best possible experience.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are multiple actions every round that you *need*... the Grande only gives you guaranteed access to one of them. Which do you choose above all the others? Which do you think you can get to via other means? Which can wait till next year? Plenty of tension. I don't quite know where Quinns is coming from on this...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joshua: I definitely appreciate that philosophy of making the best possible product for everyone and making it available to everyone (I take it you're against KS exclusives too?) I think the best I can do is assure you that it's my goal to do exactly that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't think this about the abilities. It's more about the "uncanny valley" effect of having to connect your art style with real people. I have only very rarely seen it work well, Agricola comes to mind but even there you find cards that look awkward.

Given your pitch, value proposition, artist and art style there really is nothing different to be done - but I wholeheartedly agree that these cards do catch the eye in a less-than-pleasing way because of it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well said. I was about to share the same comment.

You often want/need multiple spots each round to achieve your goals. This is true in most worker placement games but possibly even more so with Viticulture as you are often performing a series of actions in a single round such as harvest, make wine tokens, and fill an order. That's three spots you *need* and a ton of tension. Even with the grande worker you might not pull it off but knowing that you have one spot you can count on makes it a lot more fun and strategic rather than frustrating.

I thought I'd share that extra comment as I find that it's a game with a great amount of tension, and best yet it has this tension at any player count. One of my favorite worker placement games actually.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I haven't played yet, so my question is totally ignorant: If you don't like using the Grande worker, can't you just play without it?

If so, should the Grande be a variant in the base rules?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, it used to be that way. However, if you get a 2nd edition, you'll only have 5 "regular" workers plus one Grande, and the maximum number of workers is 6. So you technically have to play with it, but can just ignore its abilities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gameplay with the Grande is much better than without it (both IMHO and that seems to be the consensus), so I think it's amply justified to include it. However, you can just skip using it if you want.

If you're going to be playing a lot of 2P games and really want to be convinced for yourself, play 2-3 games without the Grande and 2-3 with it and then report back whether you will even consider playing without it again For 3P+ it's not as sorely felt, but 2P is much improved. Not that 2P 1st ed Viticulture is bad, but the Grande is an awesome addition.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For 5 players, and especially for 3, it's not bad. For 4 and 6 players, things are still pretty tight without the Grande

I have a gaming partner who has told me in the past "Most games are good, so I'd rather play games with themes that I like"

We get Vinhos to the table as a 2-player game with some regularity.

Is Viticulture different enough that it is also worth getting, as a 2 player game primarily?

I have seen several posts comparing the two for initial purchase, but it doesn't seem like anyone has asked this specific question, hence why I have made a new topic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They play much differently and don't have the same feel. Vinhos is much more complex.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Viticulture is a fairly straightforward WP game Vinhos is virtually an business/economic simulation. It's one of the heaviest games you'll likely encounter...

I found the official print and play files and am planning on building a copy. Looking at the rules, it seems like I need counters and meeples for various things like money and workers. Has anyone done a PDF that I could print to make said counters?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bertie: I would recommend using money and meeples from other games, as I don't think any paper counters exist in PnP form for Viticulture.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For my print and play version, I used the meeples from carcassone and the round markers from eclipse for to mark which buildings were built.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LEGO people might work. Alternatively, you could use cubes as workers. Another idea is to get some polymer clay and make'n'bake your own tokens and meeples. Remember: If you use meeples or pawns, you can simply tie a string to one of each color to make the Grande worker - or you can do as many already have and draw on them with a Sharpie or similar.

As for the money, I'd simply grab some small change.

I use cubes for grape and wine tokens, but you could also use small coins here. Alternatively, glass beads are available from florists and similar stores. Or use more LEGO bricks.

Wake-up track and scoring markers? Let people get their own personal small items (button, ring, die, domino piece etc.).

Has anyone worked on a solo variant for Viticulture? What are the possible barriers to a viable solo version?

I missed the original KS, but I'm going to be getting it along with the Tuscany expansion. I love playing stuff solo and would love to see a version for this one when I receive it many moons from now.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm working on it .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David: Stay tuned to the Kickstarter for details on this. We have something really cool in the works for solo campaign play.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
they are talking about a possible solo variant... (scroll down a bit...)

Edit: Jamey beat me to it...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Hugo!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm very very excited
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In case anyone missed it...

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jameystegmaier/tuscany-...

Awesome!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for sharing that, David!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that we're hopefully closing in on this stretch goal, any chance you can share more on this topic?

Thanks for your time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wil: Sure, the solo expansion adds 24 Automa cards to the game. You play Viticulture against a competitor whose actions are determined by those Automa cards. There are 7 rounds of play, and you can only choose each wake-up slot once per game (there are 7 of them, so they track the rounds of play).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the quick reply Jamey. This sounds fantastic.

Now I want Viticulture/Tuscany even more!

Looking forward to hitting this stretch goal, and hopefully seeing the Automa cards on that journey.

Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm actually playtesting Automa right now, so your comment was well timed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you take each wake-up slot in order? If not, I'll definitely have to use another worker to track that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I figure you'd just use some of the glass beads.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Holger: Exactly! Well done, sir. At the beginning of the game, you place a glass bead over each wake-up number. You can only place your rooster where there's a bead.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's officially part of Tuscany now :

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jameystegmaier/tuscany-...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm so excited that this got added to Tuscany. I have been playtesting it and it is truly so much fun! Thanks to you, Morten, Jamey, and the others who made this happen!

Cheers, David
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'd like to second this. Thank you Morten, Jamey, and everyone involved!

I've only been playtesting Viticulture Autima for a short while but I can definitely say it's fantastic and one of my favorite solo experiences.

As Jamey said in the recent update, it does truly mimic the multiplayer experience. I can't tell you how many times I've flipped an Autima card and literally mumbled out loud: "really, you have to go there? Arrgh." This is a good thing though as the cards block the spaces you want at key times just like an opponent would.

The play time is also quite short as it's only 7 rounds, and man oh man is it NOT fidly. Elegant is the proper word in this case. Well done!

I really can't say enough good things about this solo experience. To me it's truly the best of its kind as you are working hard to win and you're not competing against your top score or something like that as you would in a solo game of Agricola. It's more engaging and satisfying.

The mamas and papas also set you off on new starting strategies so it's not same-y either, and best yet, there is a campaign mode so you can explore each tier solo.

A great solo experience and a great way to learn how to play and improve your playing. I'm gushing a bit here but they really did a wonderful job. Tuscany, legacy tiers, and Autima set an amazing high level mark for games to follow.

A super happy backer.

Thank you!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm hoping/predicting that, once the world at large gets wind of Automa, Morten will get more requests to design solo modes for other games. It really is a very elegant design.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Wil! I must admit I talk to myself while playing Automa too. It's like it knows what I'm thinking!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wow! Thank you both of you for the kind words, you just put a big grin on my face.

Also a big thank you for helping out by playtesting without the playtest team we'd be flying blind. After 70+ playtests by myself it's becoming hard for me to gauge what the right difficulty level is for new players .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That would be awesome . The positive feedback I've gotten about Automa for the past weeks have really made want to try my hand at solofying another game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It does. In order to achieve this I had to buy about 6 billion mind reading probes and distribute one secretly to every human being. The bill for this should be arriving at Stonemaier Games any time now. Since you normally go all out to get the right components I assumed that you'd be OK with this .

I have a 1st Edition Kickstarter copy that I'd be willing to part with, since I'm planning on getting the Collector's Edition.

I've done away with the sleeve, it's been played twice and I'd like to keep the 4 Promo Cards. But, other than that...the box is in very good condition and I'd call the components excellent condition.

I would sell for less than I paid, since it's used and I don't believe in price gouging. The sale would be coordinated through BGG marketplace and I'd ask shipping be covered. Or I can trade if anyone is interested.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for posting the offer! But I just decided to order the special boxed combo edition and will give it to my sweetie for Christmas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would be interested in you first edition copy. How much?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry to anyone that was interested. My copy has been claimed already.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update: The sale fell through. My copy is available again.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Does anybody know if the next printing will have the "sponsored by" on all of the cards and materials? (I hope not...)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris: If you look at the wording on the reward levels for the original Viticulture campaign, my commitment to those custom art backers is that "your name will be immortalized on a card in every copy of the game." So, yes, the second edition will have their names. I'm sure you understand that it's important to Stonemaier and me that we keep our commitments to backers.

Honestly, though, when you play Viticulture, do you notice the "sponsored by" line? I never do--it's very small print.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I didn't know that about the first Kickstarter. Given that, yes, I agree--it is very important to keep that information on the cards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My question is once this comes out will it be out for some time or quickly go out of print again? The world of board games is a bit baffling because it often seems that the most popular, or desired, games are unavailable. Hard to be an evangelist for something one can't get.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David: It all depends on how many copies are purchased. We're making a lot of copies of Viticulture, many of which are for Kickstarter backers. Beyond that it's a crapshoot. We don't want to underorder, because then people don't have access to the game for months after it sells out. Plus, each game costs less to make if we make more games. But we also don't want to severely overover, because then we could be left with a lot of games that aren't selling.

In the end, it really comes down to cash flow: How many games can we afford to make? The answer is probably about 2500 retail copies of Viticulture in addition to all the Kickstarter copies. We'll probably target that same number for Tuscany.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for your response. It must be scary to print too many and frustrating not to have enough and constrain sales.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David: Indeed, that was the case with the first printing Viticulture. Our retail copies sold out to distributors on the first day. So I think we'll be less conservative this time around.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sooo... when is the next wave of the retail version coming out?

Hilo ID 1136747:
In the main rules it states if you take middle space in a 3-6 player game you get the effects of the bonus space, but I thought I read in one of the updated rules it said that you can't place a worker on the bonus space unless the other spaces have been taken. Is that true?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who knows. The rules have changed so many times, I've given up. I play by the first edition rules as written, and I'll never change! Now get off my lawn, you crazy kids!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With the second edition rules, you may always place your worker in any available space, so you would naturally want to place your worker first in spaces having the bonus. Even if you can't profit from the bonus yourself, you're allowed to place the worker in the bonus spaces, thus locking your opponents out of them.

Under 1st edition rules, you could only place the worker in the bonus space if you could benefit from the bonus and/or it was the only remaining available space for a given action - so you couldn't occupy a bonus space just to "spite" other players. This "play nice" rule has been removed.

Cheers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, andvaranaut. That's correct. Essentially, the bonus is optional, but the action is not. Thus you may place a worker on a bonus action space and not use the bonus.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To make this clear, we call it a "first player bonus", i.e. the first player to choose a particular action always places his worker in the bonus space, and is the only one eligible to use it and get its benefits.

You may also want to consult this thread, where the new rules about the grande worker are discussed pretty thoroughly:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm still hazy on bonus spaces in two-player.

The bonus spaces are normally unavailable.

Seems that using the Grande worker allows use of the bonus. If so, can two Grande share the same bonus or is the bonus given once, ie; apply the First Player priciple?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The grande worker only allows the use of the bonus when playing Aboriculture, and only in the first edition Aboriculture (unless these rules are being changed retroactively).

Under these conditions, it can be used whenever the grande worker is placed on a plain oval (in a 2-player game, that would be once per action per year, at most). If you use the grande to take an action without using an action space, you do not get the bonus.

Jamey has just confirmed that, for all editions of Aboriculture, the Grande may no longer be used to gtet the bonus on a non-bonus space.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actually it doesn't (it used to, in some instances, but no longer). There's no way to access the bonus spaces in 2P as of now, at least without some of the Tuscany additions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's correct. To be consistent with Tuscany, the grande worker only has one ability now (no matter which expansions he's used with). His only ability (other than serving as a regular worker) is that you can place him on a full action space to take that action (no bonus).

Anyone know the updated rules for these? Wife and I have been playing this one almost weekly and I'm curious how the changes may impact our games.

Can I take the same action twice with the grande worker?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm going to assume the following scenario:

You sent a regular worker to a space - let's say gain 2 lira for a tour. Later in the Spring season, all the spaces are full - one of the occupied spaces is your worker. Yes, you can send your Grande worker to the area and gain another 2 lira for another tour.

Also, if there is room to assign another regular worker you may do so. I saw a six player game where a player in one season gained seven lira by assigning three workers to that area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the scenario Steven described, he's exactly right: You can use a grande worker to take an action a second time. There's never a limit to the number of workers you can devote to an action (except the action spaces). So in a 5-player game, you could feasibly take three tour actions with three regular workers and then place a grande worker there to take the action one more time.

I just read Enders review, read the Tuscany expansion rules... And I am totally excited about this upcoming expansion.

Here are a few things I was wondering...


1) there are currently three types if viticulture fans at the moment. The first edition KS backers, the owners of the retail copies and those who are going to get a complete brand new revamped version of the game.

I hope you wld have different pledge levels would tailor to each group so we could simply just buy what we need for a complete experience and not the Whole game all over again.

First edition supporters probably want the new board available separately, and those who didn't manage to get the arbor expansions probably want the grande worker meeples...

I am just wondering if these flexible options were considered. And please no silly early bird pledge levels. Causes lot of grief for everyone...

If I may suggest these few pledge levels...

1) the 2nd edition base game
2) the 2nd edition plus Tuscany expansion
3) the 2nd edition board plus Tuscany expansion
4) the arboriculture expansion w grande meeples

Just some suggestions.

Thanks

Sam
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Sam,

Thanks for your thoughts. I've been working for months on the Kickstarter project page to address many of the concerns you mention here (and much more). And of course I'm not doing early bird pledges--I've written quite a bit about why I don't like them.

Also, just to make sure you're using the correct lingo, Tuscany is an expansion PACK (8 different expansions that you unlock and permanently add to the game one by one).

So yes, there are actually four different kinds of people the campaign must appeal to:

1. Original Viticulture backers who have Arboriculture and the grande workers but could benefit from the updated components

2. Original Viticulture owners who need the grande workers and could benefit from the updated components

3. People who want to buy and try Viticulture (when I talk about Viticulture as a game from here on, I'm talking about the second edition, as that's the version we're making from now on) before considering expanding the game with Tuscany

4. People who want to buy both Viticulture and Tuscany at the same time. This group is split into two different subgroups, as Viticulture will complete production months before Tuscany. Thus some people will want Viticulture when it hits retail in August so they can play it for a few months before getting Tuscany, while others will prefer to save a few dollars and just get both games together in November.

Also factored in are the 48 custom metal lira coin upgrades to Tuscany.

We have to consider the costs (both financial and intangible) of offering many different versions of Tuscany. If we have 15 different SKUs, we greatly increase the chances of something being put in the wrong box or Amazon fulfillment sending the wrong game to the wrong person. So limiting the number of SKUs is key.

Packaging (and the impact on shipping) are also key. Thus we're not selling Arboriculture by itself--we originally said that in the Viticulture FAQ, and it still doesn't make sense to package it by itself.

So here's what we're offering on Kickstarter in ascending order of price:

--Tuscany. Every copy of Tuscany includes Arboriculture. It factors into the expansion in a very different way than it originally factored into Viticulture, and it doesn't work to pull it out of Tuscany. I've addressed this point to original Viticulture backers, and I pledged to make up for the redundancy with the following:

All current Viticulture owners who back Tuscany will receive a component update pack for Viticulture in their Tuscany box for free. They'll indicate this on their post-project survey.

--Tuscany plus the 48 custom metal lira coins.

--Tuscany plus Viticulture, shipped together in November (coins can be added)

--Tuscany plus Viticulture plus coins. Viticulture ships in August, Tuscany in November

Anyone can add Viticulture to their pledge as an add-on or order it through our website. The Kickstarter campaign is specifically for Tuscany, not Viticulture, although we understand that the two are intrinsically linked.

There you have it! I can assure you that a ton of thought and revisions went into structuring the project in the best possible way for all types of backers, and my advisory board has confirmed that in their overview of the project preview page. Thanks for input!

Introducing Viticulture
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the big Kickstarter successes from 2013 was
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
, by Jamey Stegmaier and Alan Stone. This worker placement game for 2-6 players is themed around growing grapes and producing wine, an art that's more glamorously known as viticulture. The game plays in around 60-90 minutes, and has proved to be very popular. Its Kickstarter project was also a big success, being widely considered as one of the most outstandingly run Kickstarters for a board game in recent memory.

While Viticulture is an excellent euro game in its own right, and was generally very well received and lauded for its components and game-play, it is no real surprise that the first edition has paved the way for a second edition and expansions. The original game did have a few small wrinkles that needed to be improved (e.g. by the addition of grande workers, which give players more flexibility in worker placement). At the same time the first edition of Viticulture was certainly good enough to make enthusiastic fans salivate at the prospect of being able to add more elements to the game by way of a new expansion. And that brings us to 2014, with a Kickstarter for a new expansion (
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
), as well as for the second edition of the game.

This second edition and the expansion should come as welcome news to gamers for a number of reasons. Firstly, the release of a new edition and an expansion says something about the game's success, and this is a great opportunity for those who haven't yet bought a copy of the game to pick one up, in its new-and-improved form. Secondly, those who did find themselves somewhat frustrated by the niggles of the first edition, can be confident that this new edition is a more polished and improved version of the game, to the point that it may even cause them to revise their opinion of it. And finally, those who already do enjoy the game will appreciate the possibility of being able to add some new twists to the game-play.

I don't (yet) own the second edition, but the publisher has provided errata for the first edition, and disclosed all the changes that the second edition implements. I was somewhat late to the Viticulture party, but for me the advantage of this was that I could play with the second edition rules from the outset, because the changes aren't difficult to implement. As such, my only experience with the game is effectively with the second edition rules, and that puts me in a good position to review the game from that perspective. The components pictured in this review are of my first edition copy, but I'll explain the game completely from the perspective of the second edition, including how this new printing improves on the original. So if you're looking to find out how the game-play has changed with the second edition, or if you're completely new to the game and wondering what the fuss is all about, then this is review is for you. So let's press onward, and let's begin picking and pressing grapes in our quest for wine! Cheers!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPONENTS

Game box

Let's begin with our game-box; it's somewhat of an unusual and non-standard size with a larger depth than we typically see in game boxes, but it's sturdy and solid, and first impressions are positive. I particularly love the muted colours of the artwork. Euro games tend to be somewhat garish and typically rely extensively on primary colours, so by contrast the artwork throughout this game immediately feels somewhat fresh and unique. The second edition box cover will look the same, but will include the names of the two designers, along with a seal proclaiming "now with 6 grande workers".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The back of the game shows something of what the game looks like in play, and tells you that you'll be doing things like "Determine Worker Wake-Up", "Allocate Worker Actions", "Plant Vines", and "Earn Victory Points". There's also a complete list of the components, along with the following helpful overview of the game:

"Viticulture is a worker-placement strategy game that allows players to create their own Tuscan vineyard anywhere a table and a friend can be found. You find yourself in rustic, pre-modern Tuscany, where you've inherited a meagre vineyard. You own a few plots of land, an old crush pad, a tiny cellar, 3 workers... and the dream of owning the best winery in Italy. Your job is to allocate your workers and helpful visitors to complete various tasks throughout the year. Each season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to arrive at each one has an advantage over the rest. Using those workers and visitors, you can expand your vineyard by building structures, planting vines, and filling wine orders as you work towards the goal of owning the most successful winery in Tuscany. "
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's worth mentioning that the game also comes with a very sturdy and tidy box insert, that houses all the components nicely.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instructions
● rule book
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All the components (1st edition)

Main board

The main board is double-sided. One side features the artwork alone, but most people will find themselves using the side that has text explaining what each location does.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Card decks: At the top of the board are marked areas for the four decks of cards
Victory point track: This is located at the bottom of the board. The game end is triggered when a player reaches 20 VPs.
Action spaces: Across the board are various areas where players can place their workers, with spaces for up to three workers at each location. The spaces on the left half of the board are marked in yellow and represent summer actions, while the spaces on the right half of the board are marked in blue and represent winter actions.
Wake-up track: This is on the lower left, and is where players will place roosters to determine turn order each round.
Residual payment tracker: This is on the lower right, and will keep track of money to be awarded at the end of each round to players who have fulfilled wine order contracts.
Game-play overview: The flow of play is included on the right hand side of the board, which makes it easy to keep track of each round.

Player vineyard mats

There is a vineyard mat for each player. Like the main board these are double-sided, one side with just the artwork and the other side with text explaining each part of the board.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fields: Three fields on the top of your vineyard mat are where you'll be planting your grape vines.
Crush pads: On the bottom left are two crush pads for storing white and red grapes after they've been harvested; they will be aged according to the values 1 through 9.
Cellars: On the bottom right are three cellars for storing wine. Players begin with a small cellar, and can pay to gain a medium cellar and then a large cellar. Like the grapes on the crush pads, wine will age from round to round. Four types of wine can be made: red, white, blush (second lowest row), and sparkling (lowest row).
Structures: You can gain the benefit of different structures by paying their cost. These are pictured above the crush pads and cellars, and are as follows: Trellis, Windmill, Cottage, Yoke, Tasting Room, and Irrigation.

Decks of cards

The game comes with four small decks of cards that play a key role in how the game plays out. They're smaller than standard sized playing cards, but are attractive and do the job nicely.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● Vine cards

These 42 green-backed cards feature the vines you'll plant in your vineyard, in one of nine different varieties, e.g. Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Merlot, or Pinot. Each card has a white or red circle with a number in it, and this indicates the colour and value of the grapes that will be produced when this vine is harvested. The top left of the card indicates what structure is required before you can plant that vine. So for example, planting a Merlot requires having Irrigation structure, but this will produce a red grape of value 3 when harvested.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● Summer Visitor cards

These 20 yellow-backed cards represent useful visitors to your vineyard, and they will often give you opportunity to perform strong and powerful effects during the summer season. Each visitor is unique, and can help you in things like planting or building, and will also give alternative ways of generating points.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● Winter Visitor cards

These 20 blue-backed cards work just like the summer visitors, but will especially give you benefits that relate to the winter season.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● Wine Order cards

These 36 purple-backed cards feature the "contracts" that you're trying to fulfil in order to earn points. At the top left is the value of the wines you need to produce to fulfil the order, while the bottom of the card lists the points you'll earn immediately, along with the residual value (in lira) you'll earn each year after fulfilling this contract.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grape & wine tokens

These 60 clear glass tokens are what you'll use to represent the grapes you've harvested from your vines, and the wine you've produced when you crush grapes into wine. These are used on the player vineyard mats, where harvested white and red grapes will go on the crush pads, and age each year they are stored. Through the "make wine" action, these grapes can then be turned into wine, with white and red grapes producing wine of the equivalent value, or a mixture of grapes (1 white & 1 red = 1 blush; 1 white & 2 reds = 1 sparkling) producing wine of a cumulative value. In the first edition these tokens come in a nice rustic looking storage bag.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Workers

The player workers come in six different player colours: orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and white. I like the choice of colours, because they are somewhat non-standard for a euro, and help give the game its own unique flavour.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additionally there's also a seventh gray worker, who is an extra temporary worker that can be hired by one player each round by means of the wake-up track.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each player gets six workers in their colour, which we'll be using for the worker placement part of the game. One of these six workers is a grande worker (he's the big guy pictured below), who has a special ability to be placed on an action space that is full. "Grande workers" were originally only included with the Arboriculture expansion, but were deemed to improve the game significantly, to the point that most people considered them essential, and so with the second edition they are now a standard part of the base game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wooden structures

As the game progresses, players will be able to spend money to build structures in their player colour, that they'll place on their vineyard mat to give them special abilities and opportunities. The structures pictured here are Trellis, Windmill, Yoke, Irrigation, Tasting Room, Medium Cellar, Large Cellar, and Cottage. We'll explain the benefits of each different structure later.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tokens & trackers

Various tokens in each player colour are used to keep track of other elements that are part of the game.

Wake-up tokens: These roosters are what players will place on the `wake-up chart' at the start of every round, to determine player order, and to get one other special benefit as indicated by that chart.
Victory point tokens: These corks are what players will use to keep track of their points on the victory point track.
Residual payment tracker tokens: These wine bottles are what players will use to keep track of how much money they'll earn at the end of each round from residual payments as a result of completing wine orders.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Start player token: Appropriately, the start player token is a bunch of grapes. This will rotate counter-clockwise at the end of each round.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coins

The currency used in the game is lira, and comes in three denominations: gold, silver, and bronze. The coins made out of sturdy cardboard, and prove to be

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rules

Stonemaeier Games has all their current rules (in multiple languages) available on their website, so that's the place to find the most updated information. The first edition rulebook consists of 16 pages, and can be downloaded
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. The second edition rulebook expands and clarifies some things, as well as implements a few small changes which will be discussed below, and can be downloaded
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. I did expect some more pictures of the game in play, but overall the rules are quite straight forward and well done. An excellent reference sheet (which incorporates the updated rules for the second edition) is also available
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.

Be sure to also read the official FAQ and the official page about the second edition changes, which lists the errata for the first edition and all the changes implemented in the second edition.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GAME-PLAY

Objective

Viticulture takes place over the course of several rounds, each corresponding to a year. Your aim is to be the first to earn 20 points, which will trigger the game end. Points are primarily earned by placing workers to grow grapes, which are then crushed into wine, in order to fulfil contracts that earn points and generate income. Along the way you can do many other things to earn points or help you in this process, such as by hiring summer and winter visitors or by building various structures.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting items for a player

Set-up

Everyone gets their own personal vineyard mat, and all the components in their colour. Players begin the game with three workers (with the second edition rules, one of these is a grande worker), 3 lira, a Pinot vine card, and random summer visitor card.

The decks are shuffled and placed face down on the top of the main playing board. Each player puts the following tokens in their colour on the main board: a rooster token besides the wake-up chart, a cork token on the scoring track, and a wine bottle token in the middle of the residual payment tracker. The starting player is given the first-player `grapes' token.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Complete set-up for a three player game

Flow of Play

Game-play occurs over four seasons, as listed in a handy chart on the right hand side of the main playing board, and can be briefly summarized as follows:
Spring: Players put their roosters on their wake-up chart to get a reward and determine the player order for that round.
Summer: Players take turns to place workers in summer action spaces and take the corresponding actions.
Fall: Players draw one summer or one winter visitor card.
Winter: Players take turns to place workers in winter action spaces and take the corresponding actions.
Year End: Players age their grape and wine tokens by one in value, take back their workers, and get residual payments if applicable.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So now that we've got an overall sense of how the game works, let's look more closely at the specifics.

Spring (Waking up)

In Spring, starting with the first player who has the grapes token, everyone will in turns put their rooster on the wake-up chart. This is a mechanic shamelessly borrowed from Fresco, and will determine the order in which players take turns that round. The higher on the track you are, the earlier in turn order you'll be. When placing your rooster, however, you are also entitled to immediately get a bonus of some sort, depending on where you place your rooster. These are as follows: 1. no bonus; 2. vine card; 3. wine order card; 4. one lira; 5. visitor card; 6. victory point; 7. extra worker for that year. The further down on the chart you are, the better the rewards are, but this comes at the disadvantage of being later in the turn order. It's a neat mechanic!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summer (Placing Workers)

The different Summer action spaces

Now comes the first of two worker placement phases, and the neat thing is that you'll be placing workers in one area of the board during summer, and in another area of the board during winter, so you'll have to ensure that you save some workers for winter activities as needed. So what are the different action spaces available to you in the summer? The main thing you'll be trying to do is plant vines in order to start growing grapes, but you'll also be trying to earn money, build structures, and use visitors to assist you in this. There are seven summer action spaces to choose from. Note that if action spaces are free, you can place more than one of your workers at a location in a future turn.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Draw vine card: Draw a vine card from the face-down deck (first player bonus: draw 1 extra card).
Plant vines: Plant one vine card into a field in your vineyard (first player bonus: play an extra vine card). You can have multiple cards in a field, but the total grape value for a field can't exceed 6.
Sell grapes: Sell any number of grapes for the money indicated beside the crushpads (first player bonus: gain a victory point).
Play visitor card: Play a summer visitor card (first player bonus: play an extra summer visitor card).
Give a tour: Earn 2 lira (first player bonus: 1 extra lira).
Build structures: Pay the cost to build one of the eight structures (first player bonus: build at a 1 lira discount). The benefits of the different structures are explained below.
Hire out worker: Gain 1 lira (available as summer or winter action). There's no limit to the number of workers that can be placed here.

How placement works

There are a few important things to note about how the worker placement functions in Viticulture:

Number of available spaces: The amount of workers that can be placed in each location is scaled to the number of players. Each location on the board has three spaces for placing workers, but only one of these is available in a 2 player game, two of these are available in a 3-4 player game, and all three are only available in a 5-6 player game. This ensures that the options available to you are similarly `tight' regardless of the number of players.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bonus space: For games with more than two players, the "bonus space" is used in each location. Basically this space gives a special bonus to the first player placing on that space, e.g. an extra card, more money, or an extra victory point. The bonus space is essentially a "first player bonus" awarded to whoever places their worker at that location first.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grande workers: The official grande worker is an oversized worker, but since the first edition didn't have grande workers, we designated one worker as the grande worker by giving him a hat using a black permanent marker. The grande worker which is standard in the second edition can be placed at a location where all the action spaces are filled (although then you don't get the "first player bonus"). This prevents your options from being too limited and gives you some extra flexibility to ensure you're never totally locked out of a key action space. People familiar with the original Arboriculture expansion which first premiered the grande worker will already be familiar with its benefits, although it should be noted that in Arboriculture the grande worker also had a second special ability of entitling you get the "first player bonus" even if placed in another action space, and this ability has not been carried over into the second edition base game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The structures

When built, the structures that players can purchase will give them various benefits:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trellis: Required for planting certain types of vines.
Windmill: Earns a point when planting vines.
Yoke: Lets you uproot a vine or harvest a field.
Irrigation: Required for planting certain types of vines.
Tasting Room: Earns a point when giving vineyard tours.
Medium Cellar: Enables you to store higher valued wines.
Large Cellar: Enables you to store the highest valued wines.
Cottage: Lets you draw an extra visitor card during the Fall.

Fall (Inviting Visitors)

During the Fall season, players invite visitors to the vineyard: in turns, you draw either one summer visitor card or one winter visitor card. Players who have built the Cottage structure get to draw a second card for free.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Winter (Placing Workers)

The different Winter action spaces

Players will already have placed some of their workers during the summer phase, so at this point they can in turns place their remaining workers - but only in the winter action spaces. As well as training workers and using visitors, the key thing you'll be doing during winter is harvesting your grapes, then turning them into wine, and fulfilling wine orders to earn points. We'll explain how harvesting and making wine for wine order works in more detail below, but here's an overview of all seven different winter actions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harvest field: Harvest all grapes from one field (first player bonus: harvest a second field).
Make wine: Make two wine tokens from the grapes on your crush pad (first player bonus: make a third wine token).
Fill wine order: Discard wine tokens to fulfil a wine order card for points (first player bonus: gain an extra point).
Draw wine order card: Draw a wine order card from the face-down deck (first player bonus: draw an extra card).
Play visitor card: Play a winter visitor card (first player bonus: play an extra winter visitor card).
Train a worker: Pay 4 lira to gain an extra worker that you can use from the next round onwards (first player bonus: pay only 3 lira).
Hire out worker: Gain 1 lira (available as summer or winter action). There's no limit to the number of workers that can be placed here.

Harvesting grapes

When taking the Harvest action, you harvest all the grapes from a single field. You simply add together the value of the grapes in that field, and then place a token corresponding to that value on your crush pad.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For example, if you had a field with several vines that had white grapes totaling 2 and red grapes totaling 4, you would place one glass token on the 2 of your crush pad for white grapes, and one glass token on the 4 of your crush pad for red grapes.

Making wine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When taking the Make Wine action (note that the rules about this have changed slightly from the first edition), you may make up to two wine tokens by crushing grapes from your crush pads.
Red/white wine: To make a red or white wine, you simply take the token from the crush pad and move it to the cellar space of the same value, e.g. a white grape of value 3 would make a white wine of value 3.
Blush wine: Blush wine is made by blending one red grape with one white grape. You take one red grape token and one white grape token, add their values together, and place one token on the cellar space for the total value, e.g. a white grape of value 3 and a red grape of value 4 could be blended to make a single blush wine token of value 7.
Sparkling wine: Sparkling wine is made by blending two red grapes with one white grape, and again you use the cumulative total. For example, a white grape of value 3 and a red grape of value 4 and a red grape of value 2 would make a single sparkling wine token of value 9.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that you need to have room in your cellar to make wine tokens, and that's where building a medium and a large cellar can be important. For example, if you don't yet have a large cellar, then a blush wine token of 7 value has to be devalued and becomes a blush wine token of 6. Using the "first player bonus" space (or your grande worker) lets you make up to three wine tokens as an action, instead of just two.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fulfilling wine orders

When taking the action to fulfil a wine order, you play a wine order card from your hand, and discard the required wine tokens from your cellar, which must equal or exceed the requirements of the card. For example, in the picture below a player can discard a white wine token of value 3 or more and a sparkling wine of value 8 or more, and gets 6 victory points.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fulfilling a wine order also entitles you to advance your token on the residual payment track by the amount of lira shown on the wine order card. This basically entitles you to a small amount of income at the end of every round, and the idea is that someone has bought wine for you, and is paying for it over several years.

Year End (Upkeep)

At the end of a round, you round off your year by performing the following actions:

Aging: All grape and wine tokens are "aged", by advancing them one value on your crush pads and cellars.
Return workers: Collect all your workers from the main board.
Residual payments: If applicable, collect the amount of lira indicated by your token on the residual payment track.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Discard: You can only have a maximum hand size of 7 cards at the end of a round, discarding cards if necessary.
First player: The first player grapes token rotates counter clockwise, and roosters are removed from wake-up chart in order to be placed during the next Spring.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
End of Game

The game end is triggered when one player reaches 20 points. This marks the final year/round, which is played out in its entirety, and at that point the player with the most points wins, with the most money serving as the first tiebreaker. The tiebreaker will come into play on occasion! Note also that the scoring is deliberately capped at a maximum of 25 points.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECOND EDITION CHANGES

The explanation given above is for the rules of the second edition, which are now considered to be the standard way of playing the game, and it's recommended that owners of the first edition also play in this way. But for the benefit of owners of the first edition, let's just summarize the changes implemented by the second edition.

Rule changes

You'll find the official list of rule changes here, but this is an overview of the key rule changes in the new edition:

Grande worker: The grande worker wasn't part of the first edition, but only part of the Arboriculture expansion. All players now start with a grande worker, who has the ability to be placed on an already full action to perform that action. This ensures that players don't get totally blocked out from an essential action, and removes some of the brutal tightness that some people complained about with the first edition rules. As mentioned already, the Aboriculture expansion also gives the grande worker an additional ability to get the `first player bonus' when it's placed on an empty action space; this ability was originally going to be part of the second edition rules too (as discussed here) and that's the way we played many of our games. However given that the forthcoming expansion will feature new workers that each have one unique ability, it was decided to slim down the grande worker to one ability in the base game as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Making wine: The "make wine" action was previously known as "crush grapes", and instead of allowing players to make two wine tokens, it enabled players to make certain types of wines only. The original rule was confusing, and also overly restrictive, and that's why this change is a good one.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Visitor cards: Three visitor cards (Entertainer, Handyman, Horticulturalist) were considered to be unbalanced to the point of being unfun, and their abilities have been changed to the following:
● Entertainer: Pay $4 to draw 3 winter visitor cards OR discard 1 wine token and 3 visitor cards to gain 3 VP.
● Handyman: All players may build 1 structure at a $2 discount. You gain 1 VP for each other player who does this.
● Horticulturist: Plant any 1 vine even if you don’t have the structure(s) required OR uproot and discard 2 vine cards to gain 3 VP.
Minor edits only were made to several other visitor cards (Vendor, Mentor, Crush Expert, Jack of All Trades, Crusher, Uncertified Oenologist, Tour Guide, Novice Guide).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Friendly variant: In the first edition, players couldn't put a worker on the "first player bonus" space unless they could actually use the bonus. The intent was to keep the game "friendly", but this rule is confusing to explain and somewhat counter intuitive, so in the second edition this "be nice" rule has become a variant. I like the revised rule more than the variant, because it makes good sense to assign the first player bonus only to the first player placing a worker in a location. Note with both the first and second edition rules, you still can't block other players by place a worker at an action space where you can't perform the ability at all.

Minor changes: The starting player is now to be selected randomly (in the first edition this was awarded to the previous loser), and the yoke's abilities (uproot one vine or harvest one field) can be used in either season (in the first edition uprooting was a summer only action and harvesting a winter only action).

Component changes

Here's the list of component changes that the publisher has announced:
● 6 grande workers added (1 per player)
● 10 visitor cards revised
● vineyard mat: small edits and a wine-making key, as well as color coding for each player
● board: wine-making action changed in line with revised rules
● smaller sized glass tokens (10mm) for wine and grapes so they fit better on the crush pad, no rustic bag for storage
● reduced number of glass tokens and coin tokens (not as many are needed)
● linen-embossed box, player mats, board, and tokens
● quick reference guide added
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As explained here, the Tuscany expansion from Kickstarter will contain everything needed (e.g. grande meeples, rule updates, revised cards) to effectively upgrade copies of the first edition Viticulture to the second edition.

EXPANSIONS

Arboriculture

The
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
was released together with the original Kickstarter for the game. It adds an extension that players add to their vineyard mats, which enables them to grow additional crops: olives, apples, and tomatoes. The expansion includes a deck of arbor cards corresponding to these new crops. The grande worker of second edition Viticulture also first appeared in the Arboriculture expansion, although it had two abilities rather than just one. There is also a morale track that players need to worth with. This expansion was generally received favourably, and added some extra complexity and length to the base game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuscany

The
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
has not yet been released yet, and is coming out on Kickstarter on March 12. From what I've been able to learn about it so far, it sounds fantastic! It will contain various modules that are unlocked and added to the game in stages, with the order in which this happens being determined by the outcome of the games you play. To quote designer Jamey Stegmaier: "Tuscany will unravel in tiers--that is, when you open to box, you'll see the first tier of stuff, and you have to play with that stuff before you open the next tier." It sounds almost a bit like Risk Legacy, and is sure to attract real interest! The official materials for this expansion also include the following: "These expansions add asymmetric starting resources, new and advanced visitor cards, an extended game board for actions in all four seasons, special types of worker meeples, and more." Wow - bring on that Kickstarter Jamey!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSIONS

What do I think?

● The Mediocre: Things I'm lukewarm about

Let me tell you up front that I love Viticulture! And I'm going to make a lot of positive comments about it! But that doesn't mean it is without some weaknesses, so I'll start with those:

Cottage versus Windmill/Tasting Room: I wonder whether the Cottage is overpowered in comparison to the Windmill and Tasting Room (see extensive discussion
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
). In our games, the Cottage has often been an attractive and almost essential early option because it only costs 4 lira, and gets you extra Visitor cards throughout the game. Given the importance of Visitor cards, and how strong and useful some of them can be, it seems hard to overlook this strategy in favour of something else. Buying a Windmill/Tasting Room late in the game is usually not worthwhile, because you won't get opportunity to exploit their abilities to generate points; but they're expensive to buy early in the game, and I still need to be convinced that you can win with them instead of the Cottage, and I wonder if their cost need to be lowered to make them more viable. As a counterpoint to this, it should be mentioned that this apparent weakness does depend on the number players; for example, in our two player games, which typically lasted more rounds given the absence of the bonus spaces, the Windmill and Tasting Room both proved quite viable.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Random card draw: I'll be including the cards in my list of positives shortly, so consider this criticism with a grain of salt. I don't mind the randomness of the draw that is usually inevitable in games that rely on cards, and for the most part it's acceptable and even desirable in Viticulture. But there are going to be situations where you just don't draw cards that are useful, and you may feel a little hosed by luck. For example the Visitor cards are usually quite situational, and it can be somewhat painful if at the end of the game you keep drawing cards that are only useful for the early stages, or if you draw wine order cards that are quite useless to you. To me this isn't as big an issue as some people think it is, and it wasn't a big factor in our games, but it shows the importance of finding ways to draw cards, and try to maximize what is in your hand.

Late game money: The residual payment track seems like an unnecessary part of the game, and leads players to have an excess of money in the closing stages that can't readily be converted to points or used profitably in any way. I like the way in which fulfilling wine orders gives players an income, but players will rarely have a use for this money in the final few rounds. For more discussion on this point, see
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. Rumour has it that the Tuscany expansion will give new opportunities to use late game cash. Meanwhile, one can always use a
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
where players can earn 1VP for every 10 lira at game end.

Minor issues: There are a few other minor niggles that I've also noticed, for example the fact that that scoring is capped at 25 points. This limit seems to be an artificial constraint (perhaps dictated by the space available for the score track on the game board) that unnecessarily forces some games to be decided by the tiebreaker, the result being that it can happen that the player who could have got the most VPs won't end up winning simply because of a limited scoring track (see discussion
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
). However I concede that it's not often that two or more players will reach 25 points in the same game, so in the scheme of things this is quite minor.

The rough edges of the first edition: My biggest complaint about the second edition of Viticulture is that's not the first edition! By that I mean that it's a pity that the first edition of the game had some rough edges, and that this isn't how the game came out to begin with. While the first edition did get a lot of praise, there were also some reviews that expressed disappointment over areas where it felt unrefined or fell short, and the reality is that the first edition did need some polishing. This is an issue that afflicts more Kickstarter games, and in some instances it's a weakness that can prove fatal. In the case of Viticulture, we've seen several rule changes and adjustments being made in an effort to `patch' and improve the game further. The most notable issue identified by many folks was that the original form of the game didn't scale well, and felt too tight with even numbers due to the greater likelihood of being locked out of action spaces that you needed during the worker placement phase. Most Kickstarter supporters could solve this by playing with the Arboriculture expansion, which included the grande worker, but owners of the retail copy of the game needed to find some other solution to get grande workers into their game (although all it really takes is a permanent marker). With Viticulture 2.0 on the horizon, I can appreciate that owners of Viticulture 1.0 might feel somewhat miffed that the game even needed fixes to begin with. Some will happily be purchasing the expansion anyway, and in the process get the official patch to upgrade their game. But others will rightly wish that the game was completely on target from the outset, and I feel bad for them that they effectively need to buy an expansion to make the game what it should have been to begin with.

Having said that, the key rule adjustments, particularly the addition of the grande worker, are easy enough for first edition owners to incorporate. I've been playing my first edition copy of Viticulture with the second edition rules, and I'm pleased to say that with this ruleset, the vast majority of concerns with the first edition are adequately addressed. However, we will have to wait until Tuscany to get the full `patch' to upgrade our copy of the game, which will not only include grande workers, but also some revised cards, and a new rulebook.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● The Good: Things I'm excited about

Now I love Viticulture. I really enjoy worker placement games, and Viticulture brings enough things to the table to make it particularly interesting and enjoyable for me. While it's not without flaws, it really is an excellent, excellent game, and easily one of my favourite worker placement games, and even one of my all time favourite euros. Here are some of the things that I love about it, especially when played with the second edition rules:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I love the theme: Viticulture isn't the first wine-making game to enter euro land, but it's certainly a very good one with this theme! You're planting grapes, harvesting them, crushing them to make wine, fulfilling wine orders, building structures on your vineyard, giving vineyard tours - all of these things make good sense on the level of both theme and mechanics. I don't know a lot about wine-making, but this is a theme that you can readily understand and get on board with, and it's really implemented nicely, and the theme is also interwoven well with the game-play and mechanics. It's a fine example of a theme done really well.

I love the components: We tend to rave about euro-games that have attractive components, and Viticulture certainly belongs in that category. It's particularly noteworthy given the Kickstarter origins of the game. Sadly all too many crowdfunded games come with substandard components or amateurish and garish graphic design, and the production quality of Viticulture stands head and shoulders above many games I've seen. What I really like about the components isn't just their quality (although I certainly appreciate that too!), but the fact that they feel unique, and really add to the flavour of the game. The colour choices avoid the traditional stark primary colours like the red, yellow, blue and green cubes we've seen in so many euros. Instead there's purples and maroons and oranges of a muted sort, which somehow fit the character and mood of the game perfectly. This is complemented by beautiful artwork on the main game board and individual player mats, which helps lend a sense of realism to the game by depicting the vineyard and its associated activities that we're busy with the game, thus strengthening the theme, and is also painted in tones that feel oddly and appropriately agricultural. It's functional and beautiful, and when you add in the unique wooden structures, the glass tokens and rustic storage bag, it all adds up to a wonderfully produced package that I loved from the moment I first saw it.

I love the cards: Some folks dislike the cards because they consider some to be over-powered, and make the game feel too luck-dependent. It's true, for example, that you could draw some order cards near the end of the game that you just can't use at that point of the game, and that can be frustrating. It's also true that you can draw visitor cards that are more or less useful depending on what stage of the game you're at, but I don't mind that too much. For me the fact that there's some imbalance and randomness in the cards keeps us from being under the illusion that Viticulture is a heavy-weight and dry calculating game that's all work and no play; it reminds us that it tends to the lighter side of medium. The element of card-draw seems appropriate for a game of this weight, and it also ensures that each game plays out differently. I enjoy the fact that the cards you draw force you to take different paths, because you can't just decide in advance what strategy you'll adopt and play the same way each time. Instead, you have to make the best of the cards you draw, and while you do need to make good choices as part of that, it doesn't turn into a dry exercise of bean-counting and brain cells. There's quite a bit of diversity in the cards, and they help keep the game interesting. One of their strengths is that they also ensure that your options are flexible; many of the visitor cards for example give you alternate ways of doing actions that you might otherwise be struggling to perform. Yes they can be powerful and situational, but for me that's part of the fun. In rare instances the cards in Viticulture might hurt me, but mostly I love them, and think they strengthen the game.

I love the flexibility: Viticulture truly does offer multiple strategies. While growing grapes, making wine, and fulfilling contracts is often part of a winning strategy, it's certainly not the only way to earn points (see an excellent list of different ways to earn points here). What I particularly found interesting is that getting more workers isn't necessarily a winning strategy or essential as it is in many other worker placement games. The different paths you can take seem quite well balanced in that regard (although as mentioned already I still have questions about the viability of a strategy that relies on buying an early Windmill to earn points through planting vines, or an early Tasting Room to earn points through giving vineyard tours). The grande worker is also an excellent addition to the game to keep you from getting stuck or completely blocked out of an essential action space. Visitor cards can often help you accomplish actions that you might otherwise not have access to, so there's often a lot of different ways to get things done, and to earn points. This is really, really nice, and ensures the game is a pleasant rather than a cut-throat and vicious experience.

I love the mechanics: The game has a lot of very interesting mechanics that one can really appreciate. The wake-up track to determine turn order isn't a new concept (it's borrowed from Fresco), but it's still an excellent mechanic and is very well implemented here. Similarly I really like the way that you need to allocate some of your workers to summer actions and others to winter actions - that's another nice concept. The whole way that worker placement works, including the use of bonuses and grande worker, is also very satisfying. Also, the manner in which you earn victory points through planting vines, harvesting grapes, making wine, and then fulfilling orders does require a chain of actions, but it feels very natural, thematic and doesn't at all feel convoluted as VP generation can feel in some euros. I also liked the way the game has you store grapes on crush pads and wine in cellars of different sizes; and although the idea of aging grapes isn't that thematic (it's done for game-play reasons instead, as explained here), certainly the idea of aging wines is highly thematic and also serves as a useful mechanic. So overall, some very nice mechanics!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I love the structures: The different structures available for purchase during the Summer not only look pretty, but give you different options for long-term strategy. I'm still not entirely sure whether they are all equally balanced, but they certainly give you different strategic paths. Will you go for a Tasting Room and try to generate points through giving vineyard tours? Will you opt for a Windmill and try to rack up a score by planting vines in conjunction with making wine and fulfilling orders? Or will you build a Cottage to try to improve your luck with the Visitor cards? Or will you instead save your money for Winter to get another worker? The decision is yours, and what you decide will affect how you have to play the rest of the game!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I love the tension: One thing I really appreciate about Viticulture is how the different ways of scoring points means that a player's position in the game isn't always measurable. This keeps games tense, because while one player might be racking up points gradually with a Windmill, Tasting Room, and on the Wake-up Track, another player might be working on a longer term wine-making plan, and might have visitor cards or wine order cards in hand that could give them a bucket-load of points in the last couple of rounds. As a result, the runaway leader syndrome that afflicts some games isn't present here; in fact in one game I triggered the game end with 20 points when my two opponents only had 11 points, and they passed me before the game ended! This keeps games tense and exciting until the very end.

I love the length: A game of Viticulture typically takes around 30 minutes a person to play, which is exactly what I look for in a medium weight game. A two player game can be polished off in little more than an hour, a three player game in 90 minutes (typically lasting exactly 7 rounds), while games with 4-5 players take a bit longer; I'd avoid a 6 player game for this reason. This means that especially for 2-4 players, a game can be completed in a reasonable time frame, and doesn't at all feel like it overstays its welcome.

I love the weight: I'm a big fan of medium weight games that tend to the lighter side, similar to Stone Age in weight, and that's exactly the category that Viticulture falls into. I'd concur with Jamey Stegmaier's assessment: "I would put it on par with Stone Age...maybe slightly more complex due to long-term planning" (see similar sentiments expressed in this thread:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
). It's certainly a strategy game that wouldn't be my first choice to introduce to non-gamers, but it isn't a heavy weight game that burns my brain either. It's that "next step" kind of game that you'd readily choose if someone was looking for something to progress to after Settlers of Catan, for example.

I love how it plays with two: Like many other people, while I enjoy multi-player games, I'm always on the lookout for a good game that I can also enjoy on occasions when it's just me and my wife at the gaming table. While the majority of my plays of Viticulture have been with 3 players, I'm especially pleased that it also works very well as a two player game. The ability to access the bonus spaces in games with 3+ players leads to tactical choices that I really enjoy, so unless you're playing with the full abilities of the original Arboriculture grande worker, you may miss this option in the 2 player game. But overall the two player doesn't feel like it's lacking; one advantage is that it tends to go for more rounds, making strategies like the Windmill and Tasting Room more viable to explore. The fact that we can polish a game with just the two of us in about an hour is an ideal length of time, and the fact that it doesn't really feel much less satisfying than a three player game is a real strength.

I love how it's not nasty: One of the designer's acknowledged aims was to create a game that featured competition without too much conflict, nastiness, or hostility. I think it's safe to say that this aim has been achieved; Viticulture has interaction, but it's of a competitive and friendly sort. The worker placement part of the game ensures that there is competition, but not to the point where it becomes cut-throat or frustrating, and the grande worker also assists in ensuring this. In my home, games with pleasant interaction of this nature tend to be very well received, and that was also the case here.

I love how it was crowdfunded: I'm not the world's biggest Kickstarter fan, but if ever there was a publisher that really did a sterling effort on this crowdfunding platform, Jamey Stegmeier certainly qualifies in view of the incredible effort and passion he put behind running the campaign that led to the original publication of Viticulture. Jamey would be the first to admit that he's learned from the experience and would make some changes second time around, but his legion of backers would quickly testify that he did a fantastic job in running this campaign. This was certainly a case of gold standard crowd-funding, and gives good confidence for supporting Jamey in his future efforts. Jamey also does a herculean job in supporting his game, including going above and beyond in his support for the game here in the BGG forums - major kudos Jamey! Additionally, I really like how the final form of the game reflected its crowdfunding origins. Some of the supporters are represented in the artwork in the game, and others are acknowledged on various cards or on the back of the coins. This is a really nice personal touch that didn't feel overdone, but somehow adds to the appeal of the game, and makes it feel truly special, and tastefully reflects that it's truly the product of a supportive gaming community.

I love how it is unique: Few games are truly unique, or come with mechanics that we've never seen before. Viticulture is no real exception as such. But when considered as a package, taking together the theme, the components, and the mechanics, it does feel quite different from any of the other worker placement games I own. It's a euro game that doesn't really look like a traditional euro, and has enough elements that set it apart from the "been there, seen that" mediocre game that we so often see. I really like what this offers when taking all the parts together, and for me anyway, it's going to be a keeper for that reason.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The second edition
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So what do I think about the new edition, and the changes it makes? Well first of all, I'm really impressed by the rule changes of the second edition. Special mention should be made of the grande worker, which is new to the second edition and now standard for all forms of the game. This is a great touch, and really helps keep the game from feeling too nasty or frustrating, because if there is an essential action space you really do need this round, you can always allocate your grande worker to that space to ensure you're not completely blocked from carrying out your strategy. I also liked the grande worker's original ability to get the first player bonus if it is on another space, but perhaps in the long run it will become evident that dropping this additional ability was a good design decision. For now, certainly I recommend that owners of the first edition find a way to designate one of their workers as a grande worker, and incorporate the grande worker as a standard part of the game, because it's almost certain to improve your game experience.

The changes to the cards also make good sense, especially the change to the Handyman, which didn't always work thematically and caused some confusion. Other cards like the Horticulturalist did seem overpowered in their original form, so it's good to see this being revised too. Simplifying how the wine-making action worked also was a good move. As for the component changes, they mainly seem to be a matter of cosmetic polishing and as such can only be welcomed.

Overall, I'm convinced that the second edition of Viticulture turns a very good game into a great game. Viticulture is an outstanding worker placement game for its class, and while the first edition did have some wrinkles that need to be ironed out, it would seem that what we have in the second edition is a highly polished game that is the very best it can be. And when you add in the exciting promise of the Tuscany expansion, then it only gets better! While it's a pity that the original game wasn't without flaws, the good news is that now Viticulture is the game we all want it to be. Many of the initial haters of Viticulture may well revise their opinion if they play the second edition of the game, and if you've been considering the game, then the second edition is definitely the one to get. Meanwhile fans of the first edition who already enjoy the game a lot, will undoubtedly be excited about the possibility of expanding their Viticulture with the help of the Tuscany expansion, and effectively upgrading to the second edition in the process.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What do others think?

The criticism

Although it's a popular game, Viticulture does have its share of critics. Some of the more major criticisms that the game has received include the following:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● The cards are imbalanced and this makes the game subject to lucky card draws. Response: It's true that some cards are situational, some being more useful in the early rather than the late game, for example, or depending on what strategy you've been pursuing. This can cause some swings of fortune, but personally I like some randomness from card draw in a game, because it keeps things interesting and variable, and I think it's appropriate for a game of this weight. Had Viticulture been a more heavy-weight game, it would be a game-breaker, for sure, but given that it is a medium weight game on the lighter side that plays in 60-90 minutes, I don't mind this. Just be aware that some people do find the situational cards and amount of luck unacceptable.

● Essential action spaces are unavailable to some players (especially in 4 and 6 player games, so it scales poorly), and it becomes a frustrating exercise when key actions are blocked. Response: This was a flaw with the first edition of the game, but in my view incorporating the more flexible grande worker into the game has effectively solved this issue. Games with even numbers of players are certainly tighter than games with odd numbers of player, but the grande worker prevents the game becoming infuriating. I'd still avoid the 6 player game though, but for reasons of time; it probably runs on just a little too long.

● It's under-developed and unpolished; too many modifications and house rules are needed to patch the game. Response: This has some merit as far as the original game is concerned, but it's good reason to be satisfied with the second edition (or the Tuscany expansion, which includes a `patch' to upgrade first edition copies). Fortunately the game an excellent one, making the effort needed to iron out the initial wrinkles well worthwhile.

● The game rewards successful players by giving them money in the closing stages (e.g. via the residual track), but doesn't provide a satisfactory way to spend this money. Response: I share this concern too, although apparently it will be addressed in the Tuscany expansion. As the game stands, the residual track seems largely unnecessary and could have been trimmed. For now I like using Sky Zero's
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
where players get 1VP for every 10 lira at the game end.

Even the critics do laud the game for its excellent theme and aesthetics, and its mechanics (e.g. the wake up mechanic), but in general they are in agreement that the game had some holes that needed patching. I have to concede that some of the concerns are valid as far as the first edition is concerned, but I think the game holds enough promise to make it worth making the necessary fixes. And the good news is that this is exactly what the second edition offers: it's the polished form of the game that is everything we'd hoped from Viticulture, and especially with the addition of the grande worker this latest form of the game really does remove most of the concerns (aside perhaps from the concern about card randomness, which is a matter of taste).

The praise

Fortunately the majority of gamers do see the promise that Viticulture offers, and there's a lot of positive buzz about it, including comments like the following:

"Just when you thought worker placement was over and done with, along comes a highly thematic WP game that has lots of tension. This is a good one." - candoo
"This is a solid worker placement game with a lovely theme!" - Manary Corte
"Solid worker placement game by a designer who clearly has some passion for his chosen subject (wine, of course.)" - James Deignan
"This is a great semi-light euro with fantastic theme." - Dan Kobayashi
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Everyone that I've played with have loved the unique wooden bits. Definitely sets the bar for Kickstarter production quality." - Sharon R
"Another consistently good worker placement game, and at last a decent KS release!" - Adam Deverell
"Worker placement that stands shoulder to shoulder with the likes of Agricola and Dungeon Lords. Wonderful theme, and is one game I would be happy to host a dinner party around." - James Butler
"A beautiful game with great components. Some rough edges but an absolute keeper in my collection." - PzVIE
"We really enjoy this unique game and it's quickly becoming one of our favorite go-to games." - Denise Van Peursem
"Surprisingly very good game with excellent artwork from a new designer. I'm not a wine person, but it seems better than many worker-placement style games." - Chris R.
"This game has "legs" - excellent replayability." - Dave Dyer
"Everything about the game flows very smoothly and overall has great production value." - Nick M
"A very well produced and streamlined worker placement game." - Dimitris Vasiadis
"It's a medium-light Euro with a surprising amount of depth." - Vinson H
"If Belfort hadn't already killed Agricola all the way, Viticulture comes along with a pillow to smother it to death." - Kolby Reddish
"This is in my top 10 games and is easily in the running for new game of 2013 IMO." - Julia Ziobro
"Despite not being a fan of wine, this is well designed and is great fun to play as my first in the 'worker placement' genre." - Chris Smith
"Extremely good game, steeped in theme." - Mark O'Reilly
"Its so easy to explain but has a lot of depth. Plus, everything about its design is gorgeous." - Josh Lozano
"Strong theme, multiple strategic options, numerous high quality components, engaging gameplay. It's hard to imagine a better designed game." - Craig M
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The second edition rules

Comments about the second edition rules are especially favourable, particularly in relation to the addition of the grande worker:

"Second edition rules fixes the confusion with "Crushing Grapes" action, and the addition of Grande Worker makes the game a lot less crowded as this special worker allows you to take the action even if there is no available spaces for the action." - Dan Kobayashi
"Highly recommended to play with the 2nd Edition rules." - Joel Eddy
"It's pretty tight with even players, but we modified a little bit by using a "Grande" worker in even player games to loosen the game up a bit. This became an official change in August 2013." - Josh Lacey
"Finally played second edition. Rating it up a few points. Should have come with the second edition rules from the start. Insanely better." - David Turczi
"Especially playing with the 2nd edition changes, I think this game is a perfect 10." - Kolby Reddish
"Great worker placement game made even better with latest rules ... Many plays in now with latest rules, Grande worker is awesome, as is clarification to simply make two wine." - Mark O'Reilly
"The Grande Worker is a stroke of genius and really adds another layer of depth to the game without changing the rules ... I will always play the game with the Grande Worker under all circumstances." - Sky Zero
"If you play with an even number of players, the Grande Worker is a must as it loosens up the game." - Sarah Reed
"We decided to use the Grande Worker, and it was universally well received. I'm definitely using it from now on." - Matt Smith
"Nothing is "broken" with the original rules, but the Grande worker makes a very nice, and easy to implement addition ... once you go Grande you never go back, so you may as well start off using it." - Jeff Smith
"I have played 5 times always with a Grande worker and I can't imagine this game without it. It would be a much different and in my opinion less strategic (and less fun) game without the Grande worker." - Scott O'Dell
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recommendation

So is the second edition of
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
for you? If you already own the first edition of the game and enjoy it, you're almost certain to want to get the Tuscany expansion, including the official `patch' to upgrade the components of your game in line with the second edition of the game. And if you own the first edition of the game but don't like it, then the rule changes are such that it might just cause you to revise your opinion of the game, and make you view it more favourably, particularly if your primary concern related to scalability and the potential for being blocked out of action spaces; certainly you should try designating workers as grande workers and see for yourself how this changes the game. And if you don't yet own a copy of Viticulture at all, and have been holding off because of some of the naysayers or critical comments, then the forthcoming Kickstarter on 12 March means that now is the time to pull the trigger, given the improvements that have been incorporated into this latest edition.

If you're looking for a pleasant worker placement game for 2-6 players in the light-medium weight category, one that features solid mechanics, a strong and convincing theme, wonderful components, and can be played in 60-90 minutes, then Viticulture is a must-buy. This is easily one of my favorite worker placement games, and really evokes something of being on a vineyard, growing grapes in a quest to make and sell wine. The first edition showed great promise, and was already a good game, and with the second edition it's now becoming a great game. Perhaps this should come as no surprise; Viticulture ages like a fine wine, and as time passes the better it becomes. For me, Viticulture is easily one of my favourite new games from the last year or two, and I highly recommend it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally! You have been teasing the review via image uploads for, like, forever! Excellent review, as always

Just a minor tip - IIRC, Jamey stated that the rationale behind capping the score at 25 is to avoid somebody completing two high-score orders at the very end of the game (or pulling off some similar stunt). That way there's a motivation to finish as soon as you can reach 25 from where you are.

Thanks again for a brilliant review. Expect this to be visited very often once Tuscany launches
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wow man! I wish I had the time you have to dedicate to writing reviews, but even if I did they wouldn't come close to yours! Really AMAZING JOB!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epic review is epic!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the outstandingly comprehensive review! As an owner of the first edition, I appreciate the nuanced approached to calling out the mostly positive aspects of the game.

Ender--Wow. I'm speechless. This is a stunningly comprehensive overview of Viticulture. While I love video reviews, I think this is a reminder of the true power of words and photos to describe, depict, and analyze a game. I can tell you put so much time and energy to play Viticulture a number of times and put together this piece, and I'm truly grateful for it. Now to go find the best place on my Tuscany Kickstarter project page to link to this.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I seriously can't think of a more professionally developed review as this one here on BGG. I know it's early '14, but I can't see another review beating this one out for an end of year geek award. Outstanding work.

Awesome review. Seems to be an outstanding game! Where can I back....?

A power of work here mate...bravo!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wonderful. Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An excellent review as usual. I am really looking forward to getting this having played it once under the Mk I rules. I enjoyed playing immensely and put this straight in at '1' on my wishlist. Viticulture and

Ender, this is a review to Ender all reviews!!
Amazing work of art.
Thank you
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazing review!

One comment on the Residual Income track and the excess of money at the end of the game; it rewards players who sell wine earlier than other players. Since running a successful winery means selling wine and making money, it makes sense the game includes a mechanic that rewards that objective.

And having a pile of money at the end of the game just represents the fruits of several years of hard labor! (see what I did there?)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This review is incredible! I love how it incorporates the history of the 2nd edition design process by linking to forum threads from the last few months.

Ender's review of

convinced me to back the current Games of Art kickstarter so I could get the Rucksack edition and expansions. If I wasn't already a big fan of Viticulture, this review would definitely get me on board for the Tuscany ks. Can't wait for March 12th!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazingly thorough review, balanced and insightful. I must buy this game!

Oh wait, I already own it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sadly no "The enemies vineyard is down" variant.

Great review Ender and great game Jamey.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Incredibly comprehensive review that is just excellent. I don't typically read reviews for games I already own, but this is great. I appreciate you talking about the flaws in the game and bringing in how they are fixed in the second edition! This really is one of my favorite games, and I can't wait for Tuscany!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outstanding review!

Can anyone comment on how is this different from

http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/75212/grand-cru
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And no 'Ahab and Naboth' variant, either - kill your neighbour and take his vinyard, sort of Viticulture, the War Game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've got a video review of Grand Cru you can watch that walks through the gameplay. Grand Cru and Viticulture are two very different games. Grand Cru is a game of economics and bidding whereas Viticulture is more about resource management and worker placement. I personally wouldn't part with either and rate them equally for different reasons. Love both and aside from the theme play entirely differently.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Impressive work.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can safely pledge for the collector's edition, now...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just ran across this review and HOLY COW, this is the best game review I have ever read about any game. Its so thorough, and detailed yet very simple and straight forward, and easy to understand. GREAT JOB!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This review alone has made me desperately want this game. Such is the power of Ender! I'll be grabbing this when the new edition is released.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Greg! It's almost here.

I'm interested to see some discussion about the viability of a strategy involving the purchase of a Windmill or Tasting Room, particularly early in the game, and especially over against the Cottage. I'll share some of my thoughts in this post, and hopefully others will chime in with theirs. For comparison, here are the three structures we can opt for:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In our games, the Cottage has often been an attractive and almost essential early option because it only costs 4 lira, and gets you extra Visitor cards throughout the game. Given the importance of Visitor cards, and how strong and useful some of them can be, it seems hard to overlook this strategy in favour of something else.

In contrast, the Windmill costs 5 lira and the Tasting Room costs 6 lira, which is quite a big cost in the first couple of rounds. Why would you spend more money for something that seems to give you less? While the Tasting Room encourages you to give tours and so recoup your money to use elsewhere, spending 6 lira early on does come at the cost of giving up other attractive early game opportunities, like spending 4 lira to get an extra worker or the Cottage. Even the Windmill is only going to pay off if you plant a lot of vines - but even then is the payoff really equal to what you'd get from the Cottage?

Both the Windmill and Tasting Room can potentially generate 5 or more points for you over the course of a game, but only if you build them early in the game. It seems rare that they'll be an optimal choice to build in the final few rounds, because they won't give you enough return to justify building them at that stage of the game. This is especially true of the Tasting Room; even though it gives you points each time you give a vineyard tour, in the late game you usually don't need much money, so giving a tour isn't something you'll be wanting to do each round at that point anyway. Building the Tasting Room late thus proves counter-productive, because exploiting it won't usually dovetail with the actions you're busy with in the closing stages.

The upshot is that the Windmill and Tasting Room only really seem feasible if you can get them early on and maximize them throughout the game. But given their higher cost, getting the cheaper Cottage nearly always seems to be a better choice, especially with the potential for increased flexibility and power it offers through extra Visitor cards. Is the Cottage an auto-buy, and over-powered? Are the Windmill and Tasting Room over-priced, or is there actually a way to win with them?

I'm still exploring different strategies and haven't made up my mind on this just yet, but I look forward to hearing some thoughts from other gamers about it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've also often bought the Cottage as soon as it was practical - for the same reason - the extra visitor card. Given the hit or miss nature of some of the cards I've found it's better to have a range to choose from and then just discard the ones not needed/wanted.

I have played a game where the Windmill was the first structure I built. It forced me to play differently to how I usually do in order to be able to take advantage of the structure that I'd just forked out hard-earned lira for. It did *not* pay off for me and I came last! However, that wasn't necessarily anything to do with the Windmill strategy. I was just having one of those games where nothing matched - vine colours didn't match order colours, visitor cards arrived too early or late to be useful, the action spaces I wanted were always full etc...

The Tasting room I've rarely built. Usually by the time I think I can afford to use the money on that rather than something else there's no point in building it because it's too late in the game.

So, I was able to pick up Viticulture, the KS one, with Arboriculture Expansion. I have downloaded the 2nd edition rule changes and the new player aids. Just wanted to make sure I was clear on the Grande Worker.

Say if you have a 3-player game, first person goes and places a regular worker on the bonus spot. Then you go next with your Grande Worker and place it in the remaining opening spot, you also get the reward of the bonus spot, correct? (The player aids I downloaded didn't mention you get the bonus but the Arboriculture rules state you do).

and if both spots of an action are taken, you can place your Grande Worker there and still do the action, but no bonus reward.

Hope the above makes sense. Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's the way I believe is correct yes. If not I've been doing it wrong for quite some time

edit: Well, I've been doing it wrong for quite some time . As Jamey says in a few posts time, it's only in Arboriculture that it gains the ability to get the bonus, not in standard.

Full review with pictures can be found at:
http://www.pushurluckpodcast.com/2014/01/viticulture-review....


Designer: Jamey Stegmaier & Alan Stone
No. of Players: 2-6
Playing Time: 30mins per player

Mechanics: Worker Placement / Victory Point Race

Viticulture is a game about running a vineyard and turning it into a booming winery business. Players take turns in turn order to send their workers to accomplish tasks and eventually attain victory points through fulfilling wine orders, giving tours of their vineyard, planting vines and selling grapes.
At the end of the game, the player with the most points is the winner and the one who has showed true excellence in running a winery business ( or maybe all he/she did was run a successful tour agency ).
Is Viticulture fine wine in a bottle or merely grape juice in a glass? Let's taste and see!

** This review is based on the 2nd Edition rules **
Changes from 1st to 2nd Edition can be found at the link below
http://stonemaiergames.com/second-edition-viticulture/



How to Play ( very briefly )

Viticulture plays over a variable number of rounds ( depicted as years ).
Each year, the players' actions are divided by the seasons of a year.

Spring
Players decide how early they would like to wake up.
This will determine any special benefits given ( 1 victory point, 1 dollar, more cards, etc ) to the player and will also determine the turn order for the rest of that year.

Summer
Players will be able to place their workers to execute any of the following actions
1) Draw Vine Cards - get different vine types & values that affect production of grapes
2) Sell Grapes - gain money and 1 victory point if done early
3) Play Summer Visitor Cards - helps players to execute special actions
4) Build a Structure - give players certain abilities and advantages
5) Give a Tour - gain money
6) Plant a Vine - allows players to subsequently harvest the field for grapes

Fall
Each player will get a free visitor card.
Players will get to choose between taking a Summer or a Winter visitor card.

Winter
Players will be able to place their workers to execute any of the following actions
1) Draw Wine Order Cards -cards that tell you what you can ship for points
2) Play Winter Visitor Cards - helps players to execute special actions
3) Harvest their Field - produce grapes
4) Train Workers - get more workers
5) Create Wine - turn grapes into wine
6) Fulfill a Wine Order - fulfilling the orders for victory points

At the end of the year, players will check their hand limit of cards, collect additional income from their fulfilled wine orders, and will age their grapes and wines respectively.

This carries on year upon year till the end of game condition is met ( when a player reaches 20 victory points ) which signifies that the current year being played is the last year of the game.



Things I Like

1) Twists on Worker Placement Mechanic
Worker Placement in Viticulture works mostly the same as other worker placement games, except that it adds in 2 small twists that really makes the game shine.
The first twist in the game is whereby if you are first to a particular action ( and have the means to execute it ) you will receive an extra benefit that late comers don't get. For example, if you were first to sell grapes, you receive 1 victory point and money while the late comers only get money for their grapes. Or when you are first to draw cards, you may draw an additional card. Every spot on the board utilizes this twist and this makes the game very interesting and a real fight to be somewhere before anyone else can.
The second twist that Viticulture adds to the worker placement genre is the way it makes you utilize and hold back your workers. Your worker pool in Viticulture is needed for the entire year. Any worker you use in Summer, can't be used in Winter. So you have a decision to make, how many do you commit for use in Summer and how many do you keep for Winter ? If you keep too many, will you be able to get a spot to execute the action you want ? This may be just a small deviation from the normal worker placement aspect in games, but with poor planning, you may just be short of workers or left too many over for what you really hope to accomplish.

2) Deluxe Edition at a Poor Man's Price
Viticulture is extremely well produced. A game like this is normally labeled Deluxe Edition and sold at exorbitant prices. But with Viticulture, you get all the goods of a deluxe edition, coupled with beautiful art, and all at the price of a standard big box game sold at your FLGS or OLGS. Its a marvel how much Stonemaier Games is giving you at the price they are asking from you. Each structure in the game comes with its own unique wooden piece, the colors of the playing pieces are vibrant and the art is truly top notch. I can't think of any way to improve on the production of the game.

3) Theme and Actions walk hand-in-hand
The theme in Viticulture really shines as the actions that you execute really give you the feel that you are working in a vineyard and winery business. Every action makes sense and falls neatly in line with the theme. The process of harvesting grapes and churning them into wine may be a somewhat long process in game, but that's how its like in actuality. So at no point do you find yourself doing something out of the norm or something that confuses you through its implementation. This also helps to makes the game easier to teach.

4) Multiple Avenues to Achieve One Goal
Although Viticulture is a victory point race, how you get there is wide open and extremely flexible. Sure, the best way to score a truck load of points is via fulfilling the wine order cards. But the effort invested to get the wine tokens is a lot and might hold you back from other valuable point scoring opportunities. Points can be gained by selling grapes, giving tours, and smartly utilizing the visitor cards. Majority of the games I have played have been decided by fulfilling more wine orders than the other players, but there have been games where fulfilling 1 wine order was enough and the other points where obtained through clever play. I myself have won a game by mixing up my card play and taking points here and there over the board.

5) Waking Up Turn Order
I think the waking up turn order mechanic is one of the least used mechanics in games. And that's quite a shame as I like it quite a bit. I liked it in Fresco but I love it much more in Viticulture. Yes going first is usually the best chosen option especially closer to the end of the game. But if you are playing a different strategy from the other players ( perhaps focusing on selling grapes and planting vines for points ), then waking up late at the plus 1 victory point level is the one you will be constantly shooting for. Going first is most certainly important, but with the second edition change where you can use the Grande worker to take an action that is already full, waking up late with a better benefit is now an enticing and possible option.

6) Gameplay is Tight and Rewarding
Due to the limited action spots on the board ( its scales according to the number of players ), the gameplay often feels very tight as the competition for the spaces is fierce. Soon after the first year or so, everything on the board feels extremely important and every season ( except for fall ) you will find yourself constantly wanting to be first for everything.
Points don't come easy in Viticulture. Sure you may get 1 point here and there for simple actions. But when you finally land that giant 5 or 6 points wine order, there is a great sense of satisfaction that overcomes you. The work is hard but the payoff is deserving of the effort put in. You will truly feel as if you labored hard for the product you had just produced.



Things I Dislike

1+2) Imbalance of the Visitor Card Abilities
The one major flaw in Viticulture that really irks me sometimes ( most times actually ) is that the abilities of the visitor cards are pretty imbalanced. Some cards are noticeably way better than other cards in the game. This is really not just my observation but also the comments I hear from others who have played the game together with me. During the game when a powerful card is played, you will immediately get a reaction from a player or two at the table about how the card in their hand is nowhere as awesome as the card just played. And even if I don't know what card they have in their hand, I totally believe them. That's how badly I feel about the abilities of some of the cards.
Another issue with the card abilities is that they don't scale well from 2-6 players. For example, one card allows each player to train a worker for a discount, for each other player that takes this advantage, the player who played the card gets 1 victory point. So if we go round the table allowing each person to train a worker, the first 3 who take the opportunity to do so will get a worker and the player who played the card will get 3 points, now, assuming a 6 player game, do the last 2 players refuse to do so and deny 2 more points to that player? or do they go ahead to take the advantage given to them?
I suspect they will take it anyway since 3 others have done so. So with just simply that one card, the player gets a new worker for himself/herself at a discount as well, plus he/she gets 5 points ( one quarter the points required to reach the end game goal of 20 ). I cannot imagine how that card got by playtesting. It should have been scaled accordingly.
House Rule Fix: The game came with stickers that allow you to paste on anything you want, so I actually took my own liberty to amend some of the cards. For example, I placed a cap of 2 Victory Points on the card mentioned in the example above - afterall, the player who played it is also getting his worker at a discount, so the card is something like a free 2 points card

** I gave this point a 1+2 because I REALLY hate this flaw in the game. Really I Do.

3) How the Start Player Token is Passed
I talked previously on how the year turn order is chosen ( in Spring ).
What I didn't mention is how you decide who gets to choose first in Spring, and that is determined by who holds the grape start player token. At the start of the game, it can be randomly assigned, not a problem. But its how the token gets passed from then on that irritates me a little. The token is passed anti clockwise. So this means that, in a 6 player game, if you started 4th at the start of the game, you will be going 5th on the next turn, and last on the turn after. So you have to wait 3 years to finally get to choose first. This may not sound like a big deal but turn order in Viticulture is EXTREMELY important. In all the 6 player games I have played, I can honestly say the winner was either the first or the second player. The lower half normally had a poorer showing than the upper half. Which is way I will never ever ever play this with 6 players again.
House Rule Fix: I started to implement our own fix whereby the player who went last gets to choose first next year and so on and so forth ( last to first )

3.5) Not meant for 6 Players
Apart from point number 3, another reason I won't play this with 6 players again is that it just simply takes too long. A 6 player game takes easily 3 hours, and as much as I like Viticulture, that is about 1 hour too long. I think Viticulture is best played 3-4 players.

4) Cycle of Familiarity
This is possibly a small ding on the game, but when everyone plays similarly, you find that each year proceeds the same as the year before. It has happened to me only twice so far, but it was most noticeable in my latest play of it.
In my four player game, we all went through the last 3-4 years doing the same thing, choose to go first, harvest our field, crush our grapes, and fulfill our orders. We didn't need to do anything else as we were all about 5 points from the finish and within one point of each other. So everyone had a card they were aiming for and it all boiled down to processing our already laid out engine all over again till we got the wines we wanted. It was a sad way to finish the game by doing the same actions but I would say it doesn't always happen this way. The finish was close, so that made it better when all was said and done.



My Thoughts

At the end of it all, I will say that I am very happy with what Viticulture brought to the table.
So much so that I awarded it the 5th spot on my top games of 2013 list.
Yes it is not without its flaws, and yes it's one major flaw is something that at times makes me want to rip my hair out, but even then, the gameplay is pretty fine and I like how accessible and immersive the experience feels. If asked to play this game, I would likely never say no, as long as it is played within the realms of a 3-4 player game, and maybe 5 players if I had sufficient time.
It's a worker placement game that is very nicely produced and plays just as great. The twists in the worker placement really makes the game stand out and without out it I think the game will suffer a bit in terms of my enjoyment of it.

Great review , love the game also
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1111660:
I'm curious to hear more about the thinking behind the rule that limits your score to a maximum of 25 points. Was this rule purely a result of practical considerations (i.e. there was no way of fitting a score track that went up to at least 30 points on the board)?

We've not seen it very often that the ceiling score of 25 points was reached. However in one notable three player game, in the sixth round all players managed to get close to triggering the game end with just under 20 points each. As a result, in the seventh round all players reached 25 points; one player only just, but the other two players could have got at least 27 points, and maybe even more.

In this game at least, the 25 point maximum score seemed like an artificial constraint that led to somewhat of an anti-climactic ending due to the tie-breaker. I think all players would have preferred that rather than determine the winner by most money in this case, the win should have gone to the player who could have reached the highest score, and that the person who could have scored 27 or 28 points was a more worthy winner than the player who just reached 25.

Thoughts?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am not sure either. Perhaps it is a way of getting the game to end soon rather than to have players hold onto multiple deliveries in hopes of just hammering it home on the last turn?

We played on Thursday and had two players tie at 25, even though we both could have gone higher. However, I ended up winning for my first time ever, so it worked out okay in my book!

So...
My copy of Euphoria is pretty much tied up for a while now in the crazy good play by forum here on bgg
http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1103998/euphoria-play-by-for...

So it's Sunday, brother in law popped round ( well 70 miles away and an hour drive), he had previously played Euphoria a couple of times and was pretty gutted my copy was tied up! , he and my brother in Ireland have their own copies now (after I gushed about it and Paul playing it with me)...
So what game to play?

How about the "other" Stonemaier game??, you know - the wine making game?, the vineyard in a box?

I will be honest, I rated Viticulture a good game, but not played it with the latest rules - Grande worker allowing you to mimic an already taken spot by another player or indeed a spot already used by yourself , and a couple of other clarifications too.

So Viticulture it was, Paul's first game of it, so we didn't use the Aboriculture expansion, but ofcoarse we used Grande workers.

Well, we had a blast!, the game flowed better than a chilled white or room temperature red.
All of a sudden this game was making us laugh and rib one another if an optimum move wasn't made.

I need to write up a good session report, with pictures ( iPad not letting me upload here for some reason at moment)

Just wanted to share for now.
If you have a copy of Viticulture and have not played it with the revised rules - you don't know what your missing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm glad to hear Viticulture aged like a fine wine for you, Mark.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QFT. I liked VC just fine with the original rules, but once trying the new ruleset (the Grande, in particular) I'm never going back I like the Grande mechanic a lot - it's a great twist on regular worker placement, and I'm intrigued to see more development of the same concept in future games (it reminds me a bit of the specialists in Age of Discovery).

A bit surprised that Tuscany is higher on the Most Anticipated Board Games of 2014 geeklist. http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/167744/20-most-anticip...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FTFY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think it might be if I pushed it, but I like for these things to happen organically. Most backers probably don't even know about it.

At least, I hope that's the reason!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It made four categories (Overall, Expansion, Economic, Strategy). In particular, making the final Top 20 vote is a pretty good achievement in itself.

You should also be proud that the mere mention of a secret new game has already snagged 80 votes in the "Best of the Rest" section. That is a result of reputation alone (very deserved reputation).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rick--Wow, I didn't even notice that about the secret new game. That's quite the vote of confidence!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am thinking of picking up Viticulture, is there any reason I should wait? I thought someone said there might be a re-release of Viticulture (or 2nd print or something) in 2014. Let me know, thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There will be a second edition of Viticulture, and there will also be the Tuscany expansion (or rather - set of expansion) available on Kickstarter next month. If you are looking to buy the game, I highly recommend buying the game through the Kickstarter.

You can learn more by going to the Stonemaier Games website.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gordon: I would say that if you can get Viticulture for a nice discount now, go ahead and get it. However, the second printing will be available as part of the Tuscany expansion pack Kickstarter campaign in a few months.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cool. Will it include the expansion from the original Kickstarter?

I'll wait, since the copy I was looking at was 100$.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keep in mind that delivery will be several months after the Kickstarter. I was too impatient, so I bought my copy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would assume with the new KS you can get just the Tuscany expansion?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, as technically the KS project is *for* the Tuscany expansion, not the second edition Viticulture.

And although I don't have the exact details, Jamey has stated previously that backers will be able to acquire the Arboriculture expansion from the first KS campaign. Whether that is a separate item, or in included in the Tuscany set of expansions, I can't say.

And in case you hadn't heard, Jamey is a big fan of Risk Legacy, so the Tuscany expansion follows that model somewhat, as it is actually 16 separate expansion packaged together.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gordon: Yeah, I wouldn't recommend buying it for $100. As Eric pointed out, neither Tuscany nor the second printing of Viticulture will be available for quite a while (probably November and August, respectively), so if you find a cheaper copy of Viticulture, you could get it for now.

And yes, you'll be able to buy just the Tuscany expansion pack through Kickstarter.

Michael: We're still trying to figure out where Arboriculture fits in, if at all. Originally it was going to be one of many similar expansions, but we found a much better direction for the game. I'm guessing that completionists will want it anyway, so we're working on that.

And yes, Tuscany is a "tiered" expansion in that when you open the box, the only visible components will be the first tier--say, a bunch of new visitor cards. After you play with that expansion a few times, you'll open up the next tier and add in the next expansion. And so on until you have everything together.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It might be a SLIGHT understatement to say that your legions of fans (and yes, I think it is safe to say that there are legions at this point!) - also known as completionists - "will want it anyway". Frothing at the mouth lunatics willing to risk life and limb to acquire a copy of Arboriculture might be a more appropriate description.

But your update is very helpful. I sold my retail copy of Viticulture at a nice profit (but not $100!) in anticipation of picking up the Second Edition. August is a long time, but thankfully I have Euphoria (and some other games) to keep me happy in the meantime!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wow... the current Amazon ad below this thread is amazing... recorded for posterity...

"Viticulture on Amazon.com $224.99"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think the odd thing to me is that I don't necessarily think I'd recommend playing with Arboriculture, especially with Tuscany. The issue that I'm trying to figure out is how to include it. I don't want to make a half dozen versions of Tuscany, but I also don't really want to add Arboriculture to the two versions I currently plan on making, because it's irrelevant to everyone who already has it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If it's the previous backers you are worried about - don't be. Gamers can be a finicky, fickly lot, but I can't imagine that the current owners of Arboriculture are going to be overly miffed at owning it a second time in light of the other 15 expansions they WILL be getting.

At worst, consider it from a strictly utilitarian viewpoint - weighing the 1,000 or so current owners of the Arboriculture expansion against the 5,000+ likely backers of the Tuscany KS campaign who don't already have Arboriculture. In that light, adding the Arboriculture expansion is a no-brainer to me.

You mentioned previously that there are 16 or so expansions to be included in Tuscany. If you think Arboriculture doesn't fit within Tuscany as you've designed it, that's another matter entirely. IMHO, making the game the best it can be is the top priority. And you've done an outstanding job on that front so far!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Speak for yourself. I, for one, would not be happy paying for an expansion I already own.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LOL. I stand corrected.

I wonder, though Ron, would you take this attitude if it only added about 50 cents to the overall cost of Tuscany? As compared to the other 15 or 16 expansion that are included? I have no idea, but I'm just wondering how much of your objection is based on principle, and how much might be minimized if the cost were relatively negligible?

If the former, why would it matter if the added cost is so low? If the latter, at what point would the cost cease to be a concern for you?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think that whether it matters or not depends on what all the things in Tuscany are. If the reason that it doesn't really align is because there's some crossover and people will practically get the same experience I think you needn't try to include it.

If on the other hand, it's totally different and it doesn't align because it's a different style, I think it should be considered. While I have Arboriculture and am biased, I don't really think it's necessary, and am more thinking that many people will have been anticipating it and expected it's inclusion - I guess it depends how loyal you want to be to them (And this is all if the 1st paragraph reason doesn't apply ^^).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With six double sided player mats and assorted cards, tokens and meeples the cost is certainly more than $.50. However, my main concern is that Jamey indicated in the Viticulture campaign that backers would have the option of not re-purchasing Aboriculture in any future expansion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fair enough. I was not aware of that promise by Jamey.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I have a copy of Viticulture with the KS expansions being sent to me. So, I hope I didn't make a mistake getting it now. But I know my wife will really like this game and I wanted to play it throughout the spring Nd summer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why not play a double-warehouse variant? Being able to create two olive oils at once, for example?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I should clear up a few things here. And just to be clear, I definitely have to respect my original Viticulture backers, given that it's thanks to them that we even exist. Also, I want to make sure I don't make people like Gordon who paid a premium for Arboriculture regret that purchase.

I should also reiterate that Arboriculture doesn't fit into Tuscany. It's fully compatible with all elements of Tuscany, but it becomes somewhat ancillary.

However, I understand that some people are going to want it, and I will give them the opportunity to purchase it. It's not going to be something that's automatically included in Tuscany.

The idea that we currently have is as follows: When you purchase Tuscany (which will likely be $39 on Kickstarter or $49 for Tuscany + 48 custom metal lira coins, an exclusive item), you will have the option of adding on a Stonemaier Exclusive Box for $20. The Box will include an extra set of the 48 Tuscany coins, a full set of the special Euphoria resources, and Arboriculture.

I'm trying to anticipate a lot of different needs in structuring the Box. First, I anticipate Tuscany backers asking for a way to add on more coins. Second, I anticipate Tuscany backers (previous Euphoria backers and Euphoria retail buyers alike) asking for a way to get more of those Euphoria resources. Third, as we're discussing here, I anticipate that some people will want Arboriculture. It really doesn't belong in Tuscany, like I said, but this gives completionists a way to get it without completely disrupting our supply chain.

The Stonemaier Exclusive box will be available by itself after the campaign for $25 (I'd like to move away from Kickstarter exclusives altogether, so I'll need to bring up this decision with past backers). The price of the box isn't final--I need to make sure it's financially feasible. But the box will only be available directly from Stonemaier Games.

Feel free to let me know your thoughts on this concept.

I propose that winter turn order be determined by the order
in which players pass in the summer. This would decrease the
power of the first player choice.

observation: in most of our 5 or 6 player games, the game
ends in year 7 or 8. It's a huge net advantage to be first(ish)
both in the first and last rounds of the game.

There aren't enough cards. In a 6p game we end up cycling through
the yellow and blue decks 3 or 4 times, with increasingly disappointing
results as the "good" cards are hoarded.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You know there is a hand limit right?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While I certainly wish there were more cards in the game as I do find you cycle them a little too much in 6 player version, I do wonder how efficiently you're playing. Building out your vineyard feels great, but I think a lot of people spend too much time building infrastructure and too little driving the end game.

It seems that if you can end the game early, say, in the year 5 or 6 (which is very reasonable with the 2nd edition rules - my last game I barely won at the end of year 5 with 20 points 2nd place was 19) not only do you often end the game before half the players think you can and are ready for, I think you'll find you don't cycle nearly as much. I think we shuffled each deck at most once in that game…but yeah if you're going 8 or 9 years in a 6 player game you're liable to cycle quite a bit.

If the "pick up two discards" card is played as part of a two card
action, can the other card be one of the cards it picks up?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have always assumed you play cards one after the other, so yes, if you play the "pick up two discards" second, you would be able to pick up the other played card.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yep, play one card at a time. So you could pick up the first card you already played.

Thanks guys. That is correct. The note on that card (the Innkeeper) only restricts you so that you can't play the Innkeeper, discard her, then play her again (it would be an infinite loop of Innkeepers and other cards).

Your input please, thank you ~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am, especially, looking for people who are neutral or feeling negative about backing this project and would like to hear their reasons.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm not sure you will hear from many people who are negative towards backing this project in particular.

The reasons to back:

1. Viticulture is a very good Euro style game. It's not perfect, but I know I'm not alone in enjoying this game even after playing it a dozen times or more. It's balanced, full of strategic choices, and the theme is fascinating (to me, at least).

2. The quality of the game components is top - notch. The art, the materials, everything. It's a beautiful game.

3. The co-creator, Jamey Stegmaier (along with Alan Stone), is one of the very best in the business. He is polite, smart, enthusiastic, energetic, and genuinely concerned about his games and the people who play them. I doubt you'd find anyone who will be more attentive to any concerns or questions you may have.

4. The price of the game is very reasonable, comparative to other KS games.

The reasons to not back:

1. Nothing specific to Viticulture (that I'm aware of), but KS projects require a relatively high threshold for patience. The campaign will start in February, but you likely won't receive the game until 3-4 months later. And if there are any major setbacks (an earthquake in China that destroys the factory?), then it could be much longer. Unlikely, but possible.

2. KS games are not generally cheap. If you typically buy games used or from an Online Retailer (e.g. Miniature Market), then this game will likely seem relatively expensive. If you are the type of person always looking for the absolutely cheapest price, then you are better off looking elsewhere.

3. Related to 1, but when you back a game on KS, you are effectively making an interest free loan for several months to the creators until they deliver the game. If you have a problem with this, then you probably shouldn't back a KS game project.

If anyone has a specific reason to not back Viticulture, I'm curious to hear what it might be.

Absolutely - in fact every game I've played the first turn's first player's first move is usually to build a trellis using the 1-lira discount space.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There's a restriction: you can't choose the bonus spot if you're unable to make use of the bonus (e.g. play 2 visitor cards).

This restriction disappears if the bonus spot is the only spot available.

In general, in this game you're not allowed to take null actions, so you can't put your pawn on a spot when you're unable to do the action.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks everyone! You're correct that you can place workers in any order on the action spaces (but there are fewer action spaces in games with less than 5 players).

Simon, we've actually moved that rule to an optional friendly variant. You still have to be able to take the action, but the bonus is optional (and thus could be taken to block someone else from taking it).

Just finished my first game with the wife - we had a great time, really enjoyed playing.

The different roles and decisions to make balanced pretty well - a person could usually be assured of getting one of the two best actions in any season, and when choosing either more cards or going first, could not really complain when they held the first player marker.

Getting the visitor cards made a big difference, as they usually allowed two actions on a card play, and we had some back and forth on points up until the final round.

I had one minor question/gripe/concern - as the way to earn points is by filling orders, in a 2 player game the person who gets to fill order has a bit of an advantage as the only other way to get points is by playing a card - which led to the last worker placements being moot once a player went over 20 points. Is there a balance to this?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Brent, I'm glad you enjoyed your first game of Viticulture.

It sounds like you may not have been playing with the revised rules. They add a special worker called a grande worker that can be placed on an action that is already occupied. In the case you described, the grande could be used to fill a wine order even if your wife got there first. Also, there are winter visitors that fill wine orders--they're good to save until the end of the game.

Wow, are the cardboard components from Viticulture ever a dream to punch! I can't recall components punching so beautifully. I'm really liking the quality here!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On a related component note - what do you use the extra ziplock bags for?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ender: Actually, I didn't realize that all of the wooden pieces would come in their own bags, so I had Panda include enough bags for all of them. However, I've found that the insert works really well, as do the original bags, so I don't even use the nice bags!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One can never have too many zip-lock bags, and it's a nice to get more than what's needed for a change!

As you say, the box insert is terrific. You don't have the wooden pieces loose in the insert though do you? Right now I'm thinking it probably makes sense to keep each player colour bagged, to make it easier to take everything out of the box.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great job on the components by the way Jamey!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Ender! And no, I don't have the wooden pieces loose in the insert in my box.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have each wooden set, each card deck, the 1 lira coins, the higher lira coins, the glass beads, and the common game components (heart tokens, grapes, temp worker) in separate bags, with the glass beads also in the burlap bag. That used every bag the game came with.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have the wooden pieces loose in my insert, they aren't any more difficult to take out than undoing a zip-lock bag without ripping it ^^.

It only works as I have the kickstarter sleeve for the box though. A piece of foam between lid and board means that with the sleeve on the board is held flat against the insert and things can't get mixed up =)

As always, this is an abridged version of the original post, which you can find over at Ye Olde Pretty Sneaky Sis
http://clevergamereference.wordpress.com/2013/12/03/what-win...

Viticulture is a worker placement game where the players are competing to have the most successful vineyard. As far as theme goes, I enjoy this, but it’s not for everyone. I have several friends that enjoy Lords of Waterdeep but do not like Agricola, something that never ceases to baffle and confuse me. Another friend was very hesitant to try it as he said “I’m just not that interested in wine making.” After a bit of cajoling, he finally caved and gave it a try…and surprise, surprise, he enjoyed the game.

Look people, I get that theme plays a part, but don’t let that get in the way of playing a good game. Another friend reluctantly picked up Pinata when she couldn’t get a copy of Balloon Cup. They are literally the same game (save a tiny rules change), with different themes. But I digress, let’s get to the actual game.

Viticulture plays over a number of years (not literal) with each year broken into 4 seasons. The game end trigger is when one player reaches 20 VP. The current year finishes, and then the player with the most VP is the winner.

In Spring, you determine who goes first. This is one of the things I really like about Viticulture. In a lot of worker placement games, getting to take the first action is a big deal. Such a big deal in fact, that there is a space devoted specifically to it. It takes a full action to claim the right to the first action on the board on a future turn. For a genre of games whose main currency is a very limited supply of actions, this is a costly investment, one that a lot of players make. Once you take that action, that starting position and all inherited advantages are yours until someone uses an action to take it from you. The system works for sure, but Viticulture takes a different approach to this that I really enjoy. The starting player token rotates around the board with each year, but the starting player does not necessarily take the first action of the turn. There is a scale of positions with increasing rewards the later in the turn you go. Rewards include (but are not limited to) lira (the money for the game), sweet sweet VP, and bonus workers for the turn. So if you absolutely have to have the first action, then (assuming it’s there when it’s time for you to place your initiative order) you will get no other reward for doing so. Everyone who goes behind you will get something for their choice, and the further back they go, the greater their reward will be.

Summer gives us a lot of the meat of a worker placement game by means of Very Important Actions. Stuff like constructing buildings (which allow you to plant certain types of vines, give additional action options and create better wines); drawing vine cards (which will ultimately determine what types of wine you can make); planting vine cards to harvest later (instant gratification is a rare thing in WP games); play Summer Visitors (cards with special abilities that typically affect planting); give winery tours (generating money) or sell grapes (sometimes you’re broke, have a surplus of grapes and/or not enough cellar space).

Autumn is a brief mini-phase where each player chooses to draw either a Summer Visitor card or a Winter Visitor card.

Lastly in Winter, you get the other meaty part of a game. You grew the grapes in summer…now what? Winter actions include harvesting your grape fields, storing and aging grapes for future sales or crushing, crushing grapes into wine, playing Winter Visitors (cards with special abilities that typically affect harvesting and aging), train new Workers for the next year, and filling wine orders.

The last Winter action deserves a bit of special attention as in my opinion, it is the most vital to success. Filling a wine order scores VPs and residual income in future turns, which makes things easier (though not easy) going forward.

Play of the game is relatively simple…strategy and “correct” play is much less so, which is true of most games of the genre. You only have a certain number of actions per turn, limited by the number of workers you have (doi) but those workers have to last all year; so if you go crazy in Summer, be prepared to be twiddling your thumbs during Winter. Knowing the best way to balance your workers effectively between the seasons is key. Visitor cards can be powerful (and some detractors claim swingy) but you really have to play them at the right time in order for this to be true, and in that case, you’ve been working towards that end…which means that you haven’t been working towards other ends. This is another place where Viticulture shines. There are multiple and more importantly VIABLE paths to victory. Yes, you may want to build early but the building spot is in high demand and you get muscled out of it. Well, give tours. It’s not easy to build things with no money. Acquire better vine cards for more valuable wines. Play Visitor cards to augment you in other ways.

One of the game’s scaling mechanics is that each action space has 3 spots that can be used, and the number of those spots that are available vary with the number of players. The order of these actions matters as well, as depending on when you take the action, you receive an additional benefit…but only if you can use the benefit. You can’t take it just to block the space unless there is no other option for that action.

Things what I like about Viticulture:

1. It’s no secret that I like worker placement games, and I’m a fan of gamer masochism. In the excellent Agricola, you have to balance advancing your farm with making sure your family stays fed. It’s a pretty delicious tension created in that “oh shit” moment when you realize it’s a harvest turn and food is in scarce supply and a quick scan of the table reveals that you’re not the only person who has made that grim realization. It quickly devolves into a brief but cutthroat battle to avoid huge point losses for your negligence. This is not present in Viticulture…and I don’t miss it. What can replace this delightful tension?

2. Your choices matter. A lot. Your workers have to last the entire year, and are used in two separate parts as I mentioned earlier. It can be a deliciously agonizing choice to decide how many workers you save for Winter, which is made just a bit worse by watching other players happily build in the summer. Don’t worry, they’ll be doing the same watching you in Winter. Late in the game when there are a lot more workers occupying the board, this tension mounts further.

3. It plays wonderfully to the theme. I know I said earlier that themes matter more than I think they should, but I think it speaks to the quality of a design when it can create a realistic feeling of what it represents might be. When I’m Lording over Waterdeep, I never feel like I am sending Wizards to Learn Chronomancy or trying to Take Over the Thieves Guild with a judicious application of guile and muscle. Those are just currencies I acquire through different means that I use to buy VP. Viticulture oozes theme, and it fits it like a glove. I’ve never operated a winery, but I appreciate having to wait for wines to age to get better results (this is reminiscent of the outstanding Tzolkin), but to be careful that I keep my production smooth.

4. It’s oh so pretty. Viticulture is a very visually appealing game, and second only to 7 Wonders in terms of aesthetic appeal, which is saying something as 7 Wonders is gorgeous.

What do I think as a designer?

Stonemaier has done a remarkably good job with this game and have a really elegant design that is simple to understand and has a delightful complexity to its depth. They took several steps to make sure that spite plays were limited; making multiple spots available on actions, having actions that only you may take on your mat and making many of the Visitor cards have benefits for other players, even if you benefit more. The only thing that I would consider changing in a game like this would be a mechanic that adds to the theme. Real vineyards splice grape breeds to create new breeds. Viticulture kinda does this, but not in a official “this is what is happening” capacity. The other thing I would include is inclement weather. Sometimes harvests are damaged by extreme heat or cold. I would probably implement this by means of an event deck and have counters for it by actions that specifically protect from it. Event cards might say “This bad thing happens. If you have taken (action) then this beneficial thing happens instead” I can’t say for sure that that would add to the game, but it’s an aspect of real wine making that is absent from the game.

Final thoughts:

Viticulture breaks relatively little new ground in the worker placement genre, but combines a number of mechanics and balances seamlessly with its theme to create a unique experience that holds up well to a lot of replayability, which is a benchmark for quality games of any genre. It may not always be the game I’m hankering to play (like The Resistance, Coup, or Chaos in the Old World), but I’ll never turn down a game of Viticulture, which is not something I can say of many games.

This is a solid title and I would not hesitate to recommend Viticulture to any fan of the worker-placement genre.

When playing two cards, do you have to designate them both
in advance? Some cards let you acquire more cards, or have
other effects that are not completely predictable, which might
affect your choice of the second card.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave--Good question. You get to play them one at a time, so you could play one, draw another based on that play, and play that one. Or play one and base your decision for the second based on the results of the first one.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A similar question: suppose all worker spaces are open. I have one blue card that allows me to draw an additional blue card; can I place a worker on the "play 2 blue cards" space even though I don't yet have two blue cards in hand? We weren't clear on where "you can't take an action unless you can complete it" kicked in.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen--Yes, that's a fair play if you play that card.

I should note that we are moving the "friendly/no-blocking" rule to a variant, just because it's necessarily confusing to explain. So basically, you can use an action space even if you can't or don't use the bonus now. However, to use the bonus, you have to also use the action (i.e., you can't choose the "fill 1 wine order" action just to get the 1 VP bonus and not fill a wine order).

I was hoping to post this in October and then sometime through November but life got in the way. Since September 27th-29th, the dates of WaCon, I have had a couple of promotions and most importantly a baby girl.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But! I still need to report that Viticulture was amazingly fun to demo at the first, hopefully annual, WaCon in Waco, Texas. I brought my two copies and had them ready to go.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now, since this was a new conference it was understandable that 1) there weren’t as many people as I would hope and 2) that for many it was their first time and they did not explore as much. (I watched as other demo stations were left empty for some of the bigger games as well.) This was not to say that I was counting people I talked to or played with because what counted was the quality of time we had.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I spoke with many people that had remembered seeing Viticulture on Kickstarter, as well as Euphoria. A few of these people commented on how well run a campaign it was and about Jamey Stegmaier’s blog. The few that sat down to play had a blast.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I learned quite a bit about teaching the game but also was again amazed at how easy it was to pick up and play. Everyone seemed to use a different strategy and asked questions throughout the play time as they realized different paths that they could take. I was able to spread the word and give out great promos and with luck there will be another WaCon next year and I will have a copy of copies of Euphoria there as well. Thanks Jamey Stegmaier for sending the promos and thanks to Dequan Watson for running the first annual WaCon.

Thanks so much for posting this, Josh! I really appreciate you sharing the game with people at WaCon. Perhaps I'll even be able to attend next year!

Finally got this game to the table, even though the Kickstarter game shipped months ago. Wife and I only play games maybe once every 3 or 4 weeks. We have a half finished game sitting at home right now.

A of question came to me while playing. I did a quick search and didn't find the answer, sorry if it's already been answered.

Using the second edition rules, can you go to an action more than once? I'm thinking for a 3+ player game, could one player say, go to the build action more than once, even without the grande worker, if there are still available spots. I'm assuming yes.

Another thought occurred to me that doesn't have to do with rules, but the action spaces. It seems like there are certain action spaces that are more heavily contested at the beginning of the game, then never used again, like planting, once your fields are planted. (Unless you have the building that gives you a VP for planting, then using the yoke, you uproot and replant. Just another way for VPs.) Then they're are action spaces that no one will use at the beginning of the game but heavily contested later, like the Fill Wine Order space. Is my thinking correct on this? or have I not uncovered enough strategy in my half game yet?

Thanks for the help.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As long as the action space is available, and you also have the workers available, there is nothing in the rules preventing you from choosing to take the same action space twice in a year.

I've lost track of how many times I've played Viticulture now (usually in larger games with 4-6 players), but it's not uncommon to see someone take the same action multiple times in a year. Depending on what each player is trying to achieve in a given year, I've seen people use the "give tour" spot twice, while others have chose to use the "visitor," "plant," or "build structures" spaces twice based on what is available.

To answer the second part of your question/thought, a good way to utilize the "plant" space later on in the game is if you have a windmill constructed and would get a VP for planting. I've not yet mastered that particular strategy, but have witnessed others manage to win by using that as a way to get an extra point per year without having to worry as much about being able to use the coveted "fill wine order" spots. Something I had a hard time with the first several times I played was not paying as much attention to the visitors I had in hand, and instead of working out a strategy that would let them help me, I would focus on other things-- only to wind up losing pretty terribly.

Hopefully my answers help!

Hilo ID 1076859:
Has anyone tried just lifting the space limitations during the last year? That is, once any player hits "20", all spaces become unlimited for the rest of that year, and grande workers always get the bonus? Was this variant ever play-tested?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We've never playtested that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think you would see all the players pump the brakes when they hit 15-19 points and then you would have an anti-climactic finish as everyone tries to blow the top off the game in one final round.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It would make delaying the 20th point as long a possible within a given a tactical consideration, but waiting an additional year a strategic mistake.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1075299:
I wonder if introducing some kind of choice rather than random draw,
at least for vine and wine order cards, would improve the game. The
problem I perceive is that if you don't get the "right" vine or wine
order, you have to go back to the well again and again, which is very
wasteful of actions.

This might work by laying out 2,3 or 4 cards (depending on the number
of players), at the start of the round. Cards acquired by playing cards
would be drawn random, not from the visible cards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I want to try the same thing. Not sure when I'll get a chance to test it out but next time I play I'm going to suggest it. Really for all 4 card types too. You can often react to the vines and orders you end up with, but the visitors are... well... widely ranged in usefulness depending on what stage of the game you're in.

The card which allows you to increase the value of a wine and fill a wine order, is it required that you have a cellar able to support the increased wine value?

Related, is is required that you sell the increased-value wine, or can you keep it cellared (see above for the obvious interaction).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, you must have the cellar to support, otherwise the wine is not increased. Even it is because of the card effect.
Example, if you don't have medium cellar, you can not increase wine value 3 to value 4.

No, you can fill any wine that match the order card that you want to do. It does not need to be the wine that you just increased it value. So you can keep the wine that you just increased it value from the card effect.

Enjoy gaming. : )

Are you allowed to use the +1 crush bonus if that won't actually increase the value of your wines?

Are you allowed to use the +1 vp wine order bonus if your score won't
increase as a result (ie; it's already 25). Likewise all the other
board positions that give you victory points.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The +1 Crush space allows you make three bottles of wine instead of two. (This is the revised rule for the 2nd printing next year)

The 2nd question is best answered as follows: If you are using the Friendly Bonus Space Variant, then you may only use the +1 VP wine order bonus space if the other spaces are already occupied. If you are not, then go ahead and be cutthroat.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is clearly stated on page 6 that if you can not perform the bonus action, you must leave it for someone else. Unless it is the last space on the action. (but you still need to be able to perform the normal action to do so)

Yep, unless a card gives you the option, you have to completely fulfill it to play it. However, you may choose the actions on the card in any order.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And what about the landscaper, if you can't plant even after drawing a card?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then you lose the second action.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
..but if you had a plantable vine that you didn't want to plant, you'd
be compelled to plant it anyway?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right. Technically yes. But you could lie about it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm fairly sure this card says "up to" 2 structures, so you would only need to build one even if you could build two. My understanding is that you would have to build at least one, if if you have already built the three qualifying structures, you can't play the card.

For cards which allow a building upgrade, what is the situation when the "upgraded" building provided essential services?

1) you upgrade your trellis, what happens to already planted grapes
which require a trellis. I can think of 4 plausible interpretations
(a) you're not allowed to do this if any grapes depend on it.
(b) they die and return to your hand.
(c) they go dormant and can no longer be harvested
(d) nothing. the planted grapes continue as before.

2) Upgrading a medium cellar to a large cellar
(a) not allowed
(b) functions as though you had both buildings

Hilo ID 1066133:
There are currently three major games about wine, Grand Cru, Vinhos and the most recent Viticulture. I'm very active on the Wine Spectator forums and would like to introduce them to boardgaming with a passion we all share--wine. Even though all three games use very different mechanics--i.e. worker placement vs. auction, does anyone have a feel for the one that is most thematic?

There is one more point to consider--I am a boardgamer and probably none of them are. Even if Vinhos were the best it might just blow their heads off trying to figure out how to play it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think you have to go with Viticulture. It has some definite thematic disconnections with the way that grapes age and such.

However:

Vinhos is a heavy game. There is no better way to turn people off board games than to try to throw a meaty game at them.

I don't know Grand Cru, but it looks to be heavier than Viticulture.

Viticulture is amongst the elite when it comes to production values, art, and spectacular bits. As the counter to my first point about turning non-gamers off the hobby: games that have fantastic production values can be a huge incentive for non-gamers.

I think your choice is clear, and I'm not saying that because I'm biased towards Viticulture.

In my reviews I concentrate on two aspects of the game. A look at what you actually get in the box. The components of the game, and a look at both the quantity and quality.

Secondly, my experiences with the game including what I like about it and anything I don’t like about it.

This time I am going to be looking at Viticulture. It's a game designed by Jamey Stegmaier and Alan Stone and published by Stonemaier Games. (See what they did there)

This is Stonemaiers first game, though there is already a second game on the way. Both games have come through Kickstarter crowd funding. As far as I can tell it’s the first published game for both designers.

The game is a worker placement game about wine production set in Tuscany, Italy in an undefined time, but definitely pre-euro currency. The game is for 2 to 6 players. According to the box it takes around 60 minutes to play. My plays, which have all been with 4 to 6 players have typically taken around twice that.

This review is based on first edition rules. There have been some changes in the second edition which means some of the mechanics I mention in the review may now work slightly differently.

The box art is nice. It shows a Tuscan Vineyard in a pleasent valley with a river in the background. However you might well think it’s a Queen game, why? Because it’s an odd shape. The sort of thing Queen specialise in. Now it’s not that big a deal and I would not allow it to put me off a game because of it, but non-standard box sizes are a nuisance when you are trying to find a space on your selves. The box is not as wide as typical Day of Wonder (Ticket to ride) box and it’s deeper. Not a deal breaker but slightly annoying. Hopefully their next game will be more shelf friendly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lets see what’s in the box.


You won’t be surprised to find a rule book. And it’s quite a good one, pretty comprehensive, with plenty of illustrations and examples. The one thing that is a little odd about it though is that the end game conditions and the tie break rules are on the front of the rule book.

The last time I played the game was looking pretty close and one of the players asked about tie breaks. I picked up the rules and looked through them a dozen times thinking I was going crazy. I knew there were end game conditions and tie break details so why couldn’t I find them. Then I realised why, the only part of the rule book I had not looked at was the very front page. Again not a reason not to buy the game, but please guys, can you put it at the back of the book next time.

Although the game is a worker placement game, it’s also driven a lot by the cards you draw during the game. So before we look at the board I think it’s a good idea to look at the cards. Understand what types of cards there are and how to use them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The game is about wine making, so one thing you are obviously going to need is vines to grow your grapes. The green backed cards are the vine cards.

In the photo you can see examples of three of the vine cards. At the beginning of the game all the players receive the card on the left. This will produce Pinot grapes. The icon in the top left corner shows that you can not plant this vine until you have built a trellis. Once planted this vine will produce a level 1 white grape and a level 1 red grape.

The second vine is a Sauvignon Blanc and this requires irrigation before you can build it. Once planted it will produce a level 3 white grape.

The last wine card is a Malvasia anddoes not require any buildings before you can pant it and produces a level 1 white grape.

The other wine cards have a mixture of requirements including some that need both a trellis and irrigation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While not the only way to score points, filling wine orders will be the main way that points are scored in games. These cards represent the current orders you have.

In the top left corner you see the type and level of wine required to fill an order. You can always use a higher level wine to fill an order but never a lower level. On the bottom of the card are two values, the first is the number of VP’s the delivery is worth and the second is how much residual income it’s worth.

The order on the left is for a level 3 red and a level 5 white. To fulfil this order you would need to ‘cash in’ from your cellar a red wine of at least level 3 and a white wine of at least a level 5. For that you would gain 4 VP’s and add 1 lira to your residual payments.

The order in the middle requires a level 3 red and a level 7 rose, and you gain 5 VP’s and adds 2 lira to your residual payments.

Finally the last order requires a level 4 white and a level 3 white and you gain 3 VP’s and add 1 lira to you residual payments.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your vineyard gets Summer and Winter visitors. These are represented in the game by cards that can give you benefits. By default all players draw either a Summer or Winter visitor every year. There are ways to get more.

The photo above shows examples of the Summer visitor cards.

The card on the left is the Architect, this allows you to buy any one building at a 3 lira discount. The middle card, the landscaper allows you to choose to perform 2 out 3 options. Draw a vine card, uproot a planted vine card or plant a vine card. The last card, the Uncertified Architect allows you to buy up to two buildings that cost 3 lira or less and instead of playing lira, you pay (lose) points instead.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guess what, these are the Winter visitor cards. They work the same as the Summer visitors you just play them at a different time.

The card on the left is a harvester which allows the player to perform two harvest actions. The card in the middle is the uncertified teacher, this allows you to train 1 worker for the loss of 1 VP. You can not use the worker the turn you train it. The last card is the Crush expert. Normally you are restricted to making one type of wine at a time, with this card you can crush as many grapes as you want and make as many different wines as you can.

There are a lot more visitor cards, I just wanted to give you a flavour of the sort of things you can do with them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sometimes people say things are overproduced and you could certainly say that about the player pieces, they could just be wooden cubes. But lucky for players of this game they are not. The pieces are all individual and they all have a specific purpose and they add so much to the feel of the game. A big thanks to Stonemaier for going the extra mile with the pieces. So what have we got?

Starting top left the first piece (a wine bottle) is used to record a players residual income. At the start of the game players have no income. As you start to fill deliveries you will start to get residual payments every year. It is capped at 5 lira a year though so you won’t be getting rich on it.

The piece next to it is a wine cork This is used to record the players score on the main board. The next piece the cockerel is used to mark your wake up time on the game board, which in turn determines player order for the year.

The rest of the pieces on the left of the photo are the buildings you can build (for a price) during the game. We will have a better look at them when we look at the player boards.

The pieces on the right of the photo are the workers, you start with three but can train up to three more.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Continuing the lovely wooden pieces, these two pieces are not player specific. The bunch of grapes is the first player marker. Just to be a little different every year (round) this marker moves to the next player on the right.

The grey worker is a piece that can be temporarily used by a player during the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You get a main board and six player boards. Both the main board and player boards are two sided, with various play aids on one side and just artwork on the other side. The idea is that once you know the game you can play with the more aesthetically pleasing artwork only side.

It’s a nice idea, but I wonder how often the artwork only side will get used. I play most of my games at London on Board and every game I ever play there is someone who has never played before, so I’m pretty much always going to be aid side up.


The board has nice and rather functional artwork rather then anything that special. It’s good, it serves it purpose, but it’s not a Michael Menzel

Across the top of the board are spaces for the cards used in the game. Two spaces for each type of card, spaces for a draw pile and a discard pile. If the draw piles get depleted during the game you shuffle the discard piles and use them as new draw piles.


The game is played in rounds called years, each year has four phases called (you’ll never guess), Spring, Summer, Fall (or maybe Autumn, depending on your location) and Winter. (OK, you guessed that one) To a degree the seasons track across the board from left to right.

In the Spring, in player order, players decide what time they are going to get up. You can see the chart for this on the lower part of the left side of the board. Where you place your rooster on the chart determines player order. There are seven spaces, so even in a six player game not all of them will be taken.

If anyone chooses the first space, they don’t get any benefits but they do get first choice of actions in Summer and Winter. All the other space give a benefit, either drawing a card or getting 1 lira, 1 VP or an extra worker.

The left side of the board contain the actions that players can take during Summer. Each action has three spaces, how many of these are useable depends on the number of players With two players only one space is used, with three or four it’s two spaces. Only with five or six players are all three spaces available.

The games main mechanic is worker placement so players take turns (starting with the player highest on the wake up track) placing one of their workers on a space to take an action. If all the available spaces already have workers on them, you can not take that action.

The centre space of the actions gives a benefit, you can only choose that space if you can use the benefit or it’s the last space available for that action.

It is important to remember that the workers you get, (you start with three, you can have a max of six) can be used in either Summer or Winter. You do not get used workers back until the end of the year.

So let’s look at the summer actions.

Gain 2L for a tour. If you use this action, you gain 2 lira for showing visitors around your vineyard. If you use the centre space you gain an extra lira for the tour.

Build one structure. Allows you to buy one of the buildings to go on your player board. (We will look at them in more detail when we look at the player boards). The centre space here gives you a discount of 1 lira when you buy a building.

Play (Yellow Visitor space). Allows you to play a yellow (Summer) visitor card. The centre space allows you to play, two yellow visitor cards.

Plant (Vines space). Allows you to plant a vine card into one of the fields on your player board. Depending on the vine you may need to meet perquisites for doing this. The centre space allows you to plant two vines.

Draw (Vines space). Allows you to draw Green vine cards. The centre space allows you to draw two cards.

Sell Grapes. Allows you to sell as many grapes as you wish from your crush pad. Level 1 to 3 grapes are worth 1 lira, level 4 to 6 grapes are worth 2 lira and level 7 to 9 grapes are worth 3 lira. The centre action earns you 1 VP for selling grapes. You can not take this action if you do not have grapes on your crush pad.

The Fall phase is the one that’s not really represented on the board. After everyone has passed on Summer actions, the turn moves to Fall and each player takes either a Summer or a Winter visitor card.

The right side of the board is where the Winter actions take place. These spaces work exactly like the Summer spaces. So lets have a look at what you do in Winter.

Play (Blue Visitor space). Allows you to play a Blue (Winter) visitor card. The centre space allows you to play, two yellow visitor cards.

Harvest One Field. Allows you to harvest one of your fields. When you harvest a field you add all of the same colour grapes together and produce a grape equal to the total. So for instance if you have one vine that produces 1 white and 1 red grape, and another vine in the same field that produces 3 red grapes when you harvest the field you will produce a level 1 white grape and a level 4 red grape. The centre space allows you to harvest two fields. (You can not harvest any of your fields more than once a year)

If your field would produce a level of grape that you already have on your crush pad you produce the first lower level where you don’t already have grapes. So in the above example, if you produced a level 4 red grape, but already had a level 4 red grape on your crush pad, it would instead be a level 3 red grape. (Assuming there was not already a grape there)

Crush Grapes. Allows you to produce as much as you are able or want to of any one type of wine. You can produce red, white, rose or sparkling wine. If you produce red or white you simply move the grapes from your crush pad to the matching space in your cellar. So if you have a level 2 red grape and a level 4 red grape, you can crush both (or either) to produce a level 2 and level 4 red wine. You can only produce higher than level 3 wines if you have purchased the applicable cellar, so if you have a level 4 red grape but have not purchases a medium cellar, it will produce a level 3 red wine.

If you want to produce rose wine you need to combine a red grape and a white grape. You need to have at least a medium cellar to be able to make rose wine. You choose a red grape and a white grape from your crush pad and add their values together, that is the level of rose wine you produce. It has to have a minimum value of 4.So if you combine a level 4 red grape with a level 2 white grape, you will produce a level 6 rose wine. To produce a rose of a level higher than 6 you need to have built a large cellar, other wise it is a 6 regardless of the combined value of grapes used.

The final type of wine you can produce is a sparkling wine. To produce sparkling wine you need to combine two red wine grapes with one white wine grape. You add the totals of the grapes together and that is the level of sparkling wine you get. You need a large cellar to produce sparkling wine and a minimum of level 7 wine. The centre space allows you to create wines of 1 grade higher than the grapes you are using.

Spend 4L to Train. You start the game with three active workers out of a possible six. If you come here and pay 4 Lira you can train another worker. You don’t get to use the worker until the next year. The centre space gives you a discount of 1 Lira.

Draw (Order cards). Placing a worker here allows you to draw a purple order card. The centre space allows you to draw two order cards.

Play (Fill order). So you planted some vines, harvested some grapes and crushed them into wine. If you then have some wines that match the requirement on one of your order cards, you come here to fill the order, score some points and gain some regular income. The centre space gives you and extra 1 VP for filling an order.

Gain 1L for help. There is one other space on the board where you can place workers. It’s in the middle of the board at the bottom. Here you can hire out any extra workers you have for 1 euro. It can be used in Summer and Winter. It’s basically where you place your workers if you have nothing else you can do with them.

There is a scroll in the middle on the right hand side of the board that summarises how the year works and what actions can be done when. This is great, I really like to have a turn structure given somewhere. On the board, on a player aid card or on the back of the rule book any of these are fine. I hate having to keep referring to the rule book just to confirm a turn structure.

It also has a summary of the actions players take at the end of a year. Again, this is very useful so the players don’t forget. As well as collecting back your workers (The one action it doesn’t mention), you age your grapes and wines. At the end of each year any grapes on your crush pad move up to the next level. So a level 3 red grape becomes a level 4 red grape. The wines in your cellar also improve with age, so a level 3 red wine becomes a level 4 red wine (As long as you have a medium cellar.)

You collect any residual payments. (You will only have any of these payments if you have previously filled at least one order)

Discard the cards you hold down to seven if necessary.

Rotate first player counter clockwise.

Just below the scroll is something that looks a bit like a rondel. This is the residual payments track. At the start of the game all the players put their payments marker (a bottle) on the lira sign. As you fill orders and gain residual payments you move your payments marker onto the relevant space on the track. There is a maximum limit of 5 lira for residual payments.

The final feature of the map is the victory point track that runs across the bottom of the board. The track goes from -5 to 25. All the players start on 0 points but there are a number of cards in the visitors decks that allow you to trade points for advantages (Like cheap buildings). Players can not go below -5 points though. If using a visitor card would put you on less than -5 points you can not play it.

As soon as one of the players scores 20 or more points, that triggers the end of the game. The current year is completed and the player with the most points wins. You can not score more than 25 points. If more than one player is tied, cash on hand is the tie breaker.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each player gets their own player board. This represents their vineyard, the buildings they have, the fields they have planted and their current amounts of grapes and wine.

Going across the top row of the board we see first of all on the left the space for the Trellis. Some of the wines you can grow need a trellis before you can plant them. When you purchase the trellis you put it here.

Next are three fields. Each field can support up to six points of grapes. You can mix different types of grapes. For example if you have one vine that produced a level 4 red grape and another that produced a level 2 white grape that field would be full. Where you plant your vines is up to you. You do not have to fill a field before moving onto the next one. Place the vine cards physically on the fields so you can keep track of what is planted were.

In the top right corner is Irrigation. Some of the wines you can grow need irrigation before you can plant them. When you purchase irrigation you put it here.

There are four building spaces across the middle of the board. When you purchase the buildings just put them on the relevant space. From left to right they are:

Windmill, once you have built the Windmill, you get a VP every time you plant a vine, but only once per year.

Cottage, once you have built the cottage, you get to draw two (rather than) visitor cards during the fall.

Yoke, once you have built the yoke it counts as another space where you can place a worker. Only you can use it and it has a different use depending on when you use it. Place a worker on the yoke in Summer and it allows you to uproot any 1 vine. Place a worker on the yoke in Winter and it allows you to harvest 1 field. (You can still only harvest a field once a year though)

Tasting room, once you have built the tasting room you gain a VP every time you give a vineyard tour, but only once per year.

On the bottom left side of the player board you can see the crush pad. When you harvest grapes you place beads on here to record the level of grapes you have. There is also a reminder between the grapes of how much they are worth if you do the sell grapes action.

Bottom right are your cellars. You only start off with a small cellar, and need to build first the medium cellar and then the large cellar if you want to produce wines of a better quality than 3 and any kind of rose or sparkling wines.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The glass beads, that come in a kind of woven pouch, are used to mark on the player boards the grapes and wines the players currently own. This means that looking at a players board you can not only see the amount of grapes and wines they have, but as the beads are clear you can still see the number beneath allowing everyone to see what levels of grapes and wines people have.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is money, doh. You use it purchase buildings and train workers. It comes in denominations of 1,2 and 5 lira.

So what do I think of it?


It’s a good solid entry into the rather crowded worker placement genre. It’s not going to change the world but it’s one major addition to the worker placement genre does make more of a difference than you might at first think.

You use your workers in two separate parts of the year, Summer and Winter and it can be quite a tough choice how many workers to carry over from Summer to Winter. This is especially true later in the game when there will be more workers about.

Hiring out spare workers and getting 1 lira for them is not an action you really want to choose, whilst not a complete waste it generally is a sign that you got the balance wrong.

I have seen a few people mention that the game is too hard when played with an even number of players. With two players you only have one space for each action, with three and four players it’s two spaces for each action and with five or six it’s three spaces.

So yes there are more spaces available with an odd amount of players. Now maybe I am a bit masochistic but I actually prefer it with even numbers. I like the fact that the spaces are tight and that on any given turn the one thing you can guarantee is that you won’t be able to do everything you want. You need to prioritise, you need to have a plan.

Although the majority of the points in the game will come from filling wine orders, there are still quite a few ways to pick up additional points, ignore them at your peril. I have found the game to usually pretty tight so any extra points you can pick up can make the difference between first and not first.

However it’s not a point salad like far too many euro games. I’m sure I read somewhere a comment by one of the designers about trying to win the game without filling any orders and he managed to come close but could not quite do it. So to win you are going to have to fill at least a couple of orders.

But just because you need to fill orders does not mean the game is a one trick pony with only one way to win. I’ve seen or used a number of different approaches that have worked well.

Training workers as quickly as possible is probably an obvious one, which can be affective, especially if at least some of the other players don’t do the same. Of course if all the players trains workers as quickly as possible, you will soon find a lot of workers not really having anything useful to do.

Trying to get the buildings built as quickly as possible is another good way to approach it. Last game I played one player built the cottage as quickly as possible, this meant he spent most of the game with a visitor advantage over the other players. As a lot of the visitor cards can be very powerful it was a horse he rode to victory.

Producing lots of wine and filling as many low value orders as possible is another good approach.

I don’t see any perfect strategy for the game but lots of good ones.

The game looks really nice, the art work is very suitable for the theme and as already mention the pieces are fantastic. They could have just been wooden cubes, but the way they are customised to fit right in with the theme just adds to the appeal of the game. Overall it’s a very nice package.

One thing that fluctuates wildly during the game is the money supply. It’s a game where early on, no one has enough money. Whether you are trying to train workers or buy buildings you always seem to be a lira or 2 short. The vineyard tour Summer action is a very popular action in the early going. But somewhere around the middle of the game or maybe a little later the balance switches and you will start to find you have money you can’t spend and suddenly the Vineyard tour won’t have many visitors. (Except for the players that have built a tasting room and want the VP).

As stated earlier my main complaints about the game are the size of the box and the end conditions being on the front of the rules. It’s pretty good when that is the worst things I can say about a game.

It’s not a game for everyone, though. It is a worker placement game and a lot of players have had enough of worker placement games. It also is quite a hard game. The rules are not overly complex, but even with an odd number of players the actions are limited and the game is full of tough decisions, and some players could find it frustrating.

So if you want a tough, attractive looking game, which can reward a number of different approaches, you could do a lot worse than give this a try.

Excellent review....we love our copy!!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1060746:
Why did I buy Viticulture?
My fiance and another friend had the chance to try this one out without me, and came back very positive about it. We all enjoy worker placement games, and this one seemed to have an interesting theme and a couple of interesting mechanics, so I picked it up on the next trip out to the store.


What do I like about Viticulture?

It has beautiful production values.
- This is evident from the first opening of the box. In a move that is completely unnecessary but definitely appreciated, the array of little wooden bits for each player are custom cut to represent the various apparatuses on your vineyard. Clear glass markers for denoting each player's store of grapes and wines take on the color of wine they represent when placed on the board. A burlap, draw-string bag holds the money. The player boards bear idyllic artwork and are extremely thick, even including alternate art backs that exclude all of the reminder text.
- About the only thing to complain about here is the hobbit-sized cards, which are still perfectly functional. All in all production is very, very well done.

The turn order mechanism is interesting.
- I realize it is borrowed directly from
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(and maybe others I'm not aware of), but it is new to me, and I enjoy it. It both fits the theme and provides an interesting decision to begin each turn.

There are genuinely interesting decisions to make.
- Each action space has a rather limited number of activations, varying with the number of players to maintain approximately the same relative scarcity. As the main avenue for player interaction, this is a basic requirement for such straight forward worker placement games to remain interesting. It's good that it's here.
- Acquiring more workers is often an actual choice. In many games, maxing out your possible number of workers, and thus your available actions, as quickly as possible is not a choice so much as a mandate. In Viticulture, the spaces are limited enough that while training the fourth worker is absolutely required, the fifth is normally just a good idea, and the sixth is often superfluous. I found this refreshing.
- The 'first to place' bonuses for each action tend to be very strong, often leading to tough decisions between taking a much needed action that might not be there next time around the table and claiming a less pressing – but more lucrative – action space.

It teaches you about wine making.
- On my first play, it struck me as odd that making a sparkling wine required two types of red grapes and one type of white until I looked it up and found that that they are actually made that way! The more you know...


What don't I like about Viticulture?

The divide in seasons could be significantly more interesting.
- Of the two mechanics that interested me prior to purchasing the game (the other being the turn order mechanism), this one falls flat. Dividing the worker placement phase in two, requiring you to ration workers between the two, is an interesting idea, but the execution falls flat for me. As implemented, it is far too easy to plan for the second placement phase, so players simply keep the number of workers they will need for the winter.
- One possible solution to this would be free movement from one phase to the next, a la
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. This would provide tension between taking additional summer actions and getting the jump on other players for the winter actions.
- Another interesting option would be redetermining turn order between the two placement phases, with the players placing their roosters upon passing. Similarly, this would give incentive to leave potentially beneficial moves on the table in return for better choice of winter actions.

The late game really bogs down.
- There are a number of ways to get victory points, but at some point every player is going to find themselves having to actually make and sell some wine in order to get to the required 20 points that end the game. This means that while the early game has players running down a variety of different paths (or at least taking the same assortment of paths in a different order) the end game runs directly through harvesting grapes, crushing them into wine, and selling it.
- This leads me to what I see as another design flaw: every action has the same number of available spaces. This gives the board a pleasing symmetry but does not accurately reflect the value of each action which, unlike in more complex worker placement games, tends to vary little between players. A system like the one employed in
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
, in which the number of spaces for each action is varied to reflect the value of that action, with some actions guaranteeing players a spot should they want it, would prevent the bottleneck at the crush action that most of the games I played devolved into.

The cards.
- A significant portion of the game runs through four stacks of cards. These break down into essentially three categories.
- First, the vine cards which dictate which types of grapes you can harvest from a given field. These basically function, although it would be far more interesting to me if there was an offer to purchase them from with more variation in vines.
- Second, the wine orders which allow players to convert made wine into victory points and income. Once again, these basically function in that if you draw enough of them you will eventually find one that fits the type of grapes you have access to.
- Finally, there are visitor cards which give you access to actions on the board without having to take their space as well as providing completely unique effects. These are basically broken. A player who draws the card which allows them to train a worker for a couple of victory points in their opening hand has a tremendous advantage over another player who draws the card which allows them to fill a wine order. In the late game, the situation is reversed. Other cards provide some of the most efficient victory point conditions in the game, giving a large advantage to the player that draws them.


Final Thoughts
There is really no other way to say it: the visitor cards take what would otherwise be a pleasant and thematic, if overly light, worker placement game you could use to introduce new players to the genre and make it hinge on who pulls the right cards at the right time. Viticulture quickly wore out its welcome in my group, and by the end of the fifth play we were done completely done with it. I might recommend Viticulture to those looking to dip their toes into the genre for the first time or for groups that play a game once or twice before moving onto to the next. I would not recommend Viticulture to those who prefer heavier games that improve with repeated plays.

Thanks for taking your time to share your thoughts on my game, Jake!

Well this game did exactly as I thought and hoped it would do. I am obviously a board gamer.....my wife not so much...she likes to play Cranium, Scattergories etc....but I would just love to get here into some more "meaty" games....


I introduced her to Belfort about 2 months ago or so...she liked it very well...and was pretty darn good at it...so I thought hmm....she likes worker placement, area control etc.....she had never played anything like that before...


So when I was looking at Viticulture...I was very intrigued for myself, but the theme was screaming to my wife.....she LOVES to go to winery with her friends etc.....

So last night I asked if she wanted to play a game...with our 12 year old daughter as well......she said yes....lets play Belfort!


I said ok....we can...but I have this new game that you may like....its called Viticulture....

She said....WHAT is Viticulture? ....I told her its a game about running a winery...she was very very curious! And I told her the components were outstanding and I thought she would enjoy it....


So long story short...we played...she LOVED it as well as my daughter....she even asked if it plays 2 player...(daughter will be gone Friday night)...she said I know what we are doing tomorrow night.....So pumped!!!! The only thing that made her upset is that she did not get to keep the bunch of grapes...(first player)..she always wanted to keep it!


Great game, great family time...ohh and a great excuse for her to drink some wine!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congrats on "reeling" your wife and daughter into this great game.

I also introduced my wife to this game when it was released and she LOVES IT.

I also introduced my in-laws to this game as their first REAL boardgame and they both really enjoyed it. They picked up the game mechanics after the first two or three turns and with the exception to them asking a few questions for clarification here and there.....they played like seasoned gamers.

It will stay in my collection for the foreseeable future and still makes it to our table every other week at least (out of 100+ games to choose from).

I am excited to see what the first expansion they decide on for this game, I will be first in line to buy it regardless I am sure.

Is there a reason to plant in more than one field? It seems like your engine is more efficient if you put everything into one place, except possibly if it gets really full or you haven't upgraded your warehouse. But those don't seem to be very limiting factors for the efficiency increase.

Did I miss something in the rules? You get all types of wine in the field you harvest, right? And you only get to harvest one field when you take the harvest action, right? So is it always better to group planted vines together?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think in general it is best to plant all in one field, with the one notable exception that there is a summer visitor card (can't remember the name, someone help me out here) that, when played, grants you 1 VP per field that has vines planted in it.

I drew this as a starting card in a recent game, so I planted in all three fields from the get-go (drawing weird looks from those at the table), and then played this card for the max 3 VP on my way to victory.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can only have a total value of 6 in a field

I've been focused lately on a strategy of harvesting every turn. It helps that I'm older than almost anyone else I game with, so I get choose early the first couple of turns.

I've been starting with a wine order in the first year. Since I rarely play two-player, this is enough that the first turn I can build a trellis, plant my Pinot, and harvest. If we're using Aboriculture, I'll use the grande worker to plant the arbor at the same time, otherwise I'll use it to save a lire in the building of the trellis (someone almost always stats with a vine, so I usually am not first to these spots). On the second turn, I choose to go early again (preferably another wine order) and build the yoke (possibly with the grande worker), so I never need to use the grande to harvest. In later years, I can feel free to choose later slots, since I will still be harvesting. I make sure to harvest every year, while choosing other options based on my cards.

Two days ago, I had perhaps the ultimate game with this strategy. We were playing with Aboriculture, and my initial tree was olives. In the first two years, I drew the 5-blush/6-blush card and the 3-white/8-sparkling card. I also drew the crush expert in year three, and had the medium cellar built by then. In year 4 I took the temp worker and played the Handyman, converting my trellis to a large cellar. After harvesting, I used the crush expert to create a 2 white, 5 blush (4 white and 1 red), 6 blush(3 white and 3 red), and 7 sparking (4 red, 2 red, 1 white). The wine order card was for a 6-blush. I filled the 5/6 card that year (with a +1 bonus), and the 3/8 card the next year (with olive oil) in addition to harvesting again. In year six I took the temp worker again, made olive oil, combined my 2-white and 2-red into a four blush, than used the vistor card that allows you to fill a card with a +2 bouns to the value of the wine, plust an olive oil, for another five points. I also had a point from a late wake-up in year five. I ended the game with 21 points and three workers in six years, having only planted the one vine.

I'm not sure how the new errata affects these Visitor Cards?

I know the crush action now allows 2 or 3 wine tokens, but are these limited by that? The 2nd Edition Rules says:

What About Visitors Like the Crusher or Crush Expert?

For example, the Crusher says, “Crush grapes into any or all types of wine.” This card–and the other crushing visitors–retains the original meaning. Thus if a visitor card says, “Crush grapes into one type of wine,” that’s exactly what it means. Crush as many grapes as you want to make one type of wine.

These visitors are now a little less powerful than before, but that’s probably a good thing. They are still quite potent, especially if you need to make a lot of wine at once or if you can combo them with another winter visitor card.

how are they less powerful if you can still make as many wines as you want?

What am I missing here? Thanks for the help. Confusion results from here:

FAQ:

Crusher/Crush Expert: When playing a card that says, “Make any or all types of wine,” you may make as many wine tokens as you like.

EDIT:

If you can also answer my question about why these cards are a little less powerful that'd be great.

Double Edit:

My bad I get it now, they're less powerful because the crushing spot is now such badassery because it can do any two types of wines or all 3 with middle spot, and before it was harder to do more variety, because you were limited to one type of wine. Biggity bam
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exactly--you eventually answered your own question. However, the crusher and crush expert still remain quite good--they just point you in a slightly different direction. Rather than harvest-crush-fill, harvest-crush-fill, you might harvest-harvest-harvest-harvest, then crush once with the crusher and fill-fill-fill.

I am trying to decide on getting the KS or retail version of this game and I was curious what all I would miss out on if I bought the retail version?

Thanks in advance!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The full Kickstarter version of Viticulture includes the following components not included in the retail version: 4 promo visitor cards, 1 scorebook, 8 wine coasters, 1 wine crate box sleeve, 1 custom art print, 1 set of stickers to customize the game, and the Arboriculture expansion (6 player mat extensions, 18 arbor cards, 6 grande worker meeples, 6 morale tokens, and 1 rule book).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Jamey!

I remember hearing the promos and expansion MAY be released in the future. Any truth to that rumor?

Thanks again!

We're a little confused with the whole yoke mechanic. Can someone elucidate?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the summer you can use the uproot action, in the winter you can harvest 1 field. You take that action by placing a worker on the Yoke spot on your vineyard board.

Edit: you have to first build the Yoke

Edit Edit: Spelling
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, once built, you can use the yoke spot each year to EITHER uproot in summer (take 1 vine card from one of your fields back into your hand) OR harvest 1 field in winter.

Here's my blog post review of Viticulture:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
is a resource management game centered on running a winery in Italy. As with any winery you are responsible for growing and harvesting grapes as well as turning those grapes into wine. You are also offering tours to your winery, selling excess grapes, building the structures to accommodate this enterprise and competing with other wineries to make your victory points before they do.

The game uses a board divided into seasons. During the spring season you choose the order of play by picking when you wish to wake up and start your chores. Some choices give you access to one of the four types of cards, a victory point, a coin, extra worker or just preference in starting the round. During the summer months you can build structures, plant, sell grapes, give tours, play summer cards and draw grape cards. The fall is where each player can draw a summer or winter card. Winter is spent harvesting, crushing grapes, fulfilling wine orders, drawing wine order cards, and playing winter cards.

I’ve played the game a total of five times. The first was with a bunch of new players at Pax where we were introduced to the game by a representative of the company. There we were introduced to the new rules which made it easier to crush grapes. The guy who taught us to play won the game by just going after victory points and offering tours. The rest of us spent our time battling each other fulfill wine orders. This taught me the lesson of paying attention to what strategy your opponents are doing and try to prevent them from succeeding.

After buying the game, my wife and I played four more games together and found we liked the game but felt it had some flaws. The first is that victory point movement is almost nonexistent or very slow during the first half of the game. Then it speeds up and sometimes players can jump almost 10 points in one turn just by playing the right combination of cards and fulfilling big orders at the end, jumping right past the other player and winning the game. This caused me to feel like the game wasn’t very balanced in that aspect. The second thing we felt was that we didn’t feel like you really got the full experience of running a winery. Some games you just got a taste (forgive the pun) of starting up the operations just to have to shift gears and not really produce more than one or two bottles and then the game is over. To me it felt like there was too much to do in a two player game and I didn’t get the satisfaction of doing anything fully.

The game has a very high production value. The community has made some suggestions on how to use the revised rules which includes the large worker. The publisher says that a larger worker will be made available in a future Kickstarter campaign.

This is a fun, family friendly game but after my wife and I playing it for four times, we’ve decided to put it on the shelf for awhile. It’s a keeper but not our favorite.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For me, the 2P game feels different than games with more players because the competition for key spaces is more cutthroat. Although I do enjoy the 2P experience, I personally prefer playing with more because I find that I can get more things done by sneaking around my opponents' plans. Also, the wake-up track and the Grande effects are more interesting with at least 3 players.

I suppose you did use a worker as the Grande, right? I liked the game without using a Grande Worker, but after playing with it I really wouldn't play it without it now - it adds a lot of flexibility (in fact, it's a mechanic I'd like to see implemented in more games). A smart suggestion somebody made in the Viticulture comments (over at the Stonemaier Games site) is using a thread of wool or similar to put a "scarf" to a worker of each player, so that it is marked as the Grande.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keith--Thanks for taking the time to write this review. I respect your opinion, and I particularly appreciate that you gave the game multiple plays before reviewing it.

I have to comment on this part, though: "They really should just offer a free replacement in my opinion."

How do you envision this looking? Since you're aware of the first-edition errata, you probably know that we're running a Kickstarter campaign in early 2014 that will include the grande worker for people who don't already have the grande worker. Are you saying you're on board for that method, or you would expect a publisher to individually mail 6 tokens to the thousands of people who purchased the retail version of the game?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I heard there was a Kickstarter fix coming but I'm not familiar with the details. Is this a free fix, or do I have to buy and expansion to get it?

I just believe this is a major mistake on the side of the publisher. I know that if this was my fault I would personally package and send out copies to everyone involved because I would feel responsible for this. Errors in the rules I understand and don't think need to be addressed. Asking people to use a part from another game doesn't feel acceptable to me, even though it does make a semi-acceptable replacement. At the time I bought the game, ( which was before I first played it at pax), I was unaware the piece was missing. Had I known I might have waited for a version with the piece.

I know what I propose may not be feasible and I'm not aware of the story behind the error, so my opinion is based on limited information; just what I experienced and the personal feeling, I as a purchaser of the game felt.

Overall, I don't have any heartburn about the issue, I just think people should be aware that the game will require you to replace the piece, put a ribbon around one, or wait for the replacement to be available.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the record Jamey I just use the "cork" pieces that are shaped like cylinders as my grande workers. Maybe you can suggest that to people. I actually just played a game this afternoon and I love it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let's not forget that the game works perfectly (and was playtested as such a lot) without the Grande, and it's still enjoyable and balanced. Of course, I have found that I like it better with the Grande piece (and I guess mostly everyone will), but that doesn't mean that the game is fatally flawed without it or anything of the sort.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Ya--I like the idea of offering them at conventions to people who choose not to get them through the next Kickstarter campaign.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keith:

"I heard there was a Kickstarter fix coming but I'm not familiar with the details. Is this a free fix, or do I have to buy and expansion to get it?" You can find all the details about this here: http://www.stonemaiergames.com/second-edition-viticulture/ I'm not exactly sure how the pricing will work at this point. Does it make sense to you that someone who already has the grande workers (and paid for them in the original Kickstarter) should have to pay the same price as someone who bought the retail version and doesn't have the grandes?

"I just believe this is a major mistake on the side of the publisher. I know that if this was my fault I would personally package and send out copies to everyone involved because I would feel responsible for this." Okay, let's be clear here: I AM the publisher. The piece is not missing from the retail game--this was not a manufacturing error. This is an errata I decided to add to the first edition after much feedback and testing. It was not a decision I took lightly. At the same time, it's hard for me to see eye to eye with you if you truly think that it's prudent (or even physically possible) for me to manufacturer and ship 1300 sets of grande workers worldwide to every person who purchased the retail version of the game. Have you ever personally shipped 1300 packages to people?

As Kolby and andvaranaut pointed out, it's very easy to use another piece as the grande worker or simply not play with the errata at all. The game works perfectly fine without it.

I'm curious what others think, especially since I recently wrote a piece on customer service on the Stonemaier Games blog. What is the best way to demonstrate good customer service to Keith and the other 1300 people who purchased the retail version of Viticulture? My currently solution is to offer it as part of the expansion pack Kickstarter campaign as an inexpensive add-on for people who don't already have it (the grande worker and the Arboriculture expansion). I also like the idea of combining that with Hi Ya's idea of manufacturing some extras at that point and giving them away at conventions to people who purchase the retail game but don't want the expansion pack. What do you think?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The thing is, as I understood it, it was never a missing piece. It was never in the rules of the base game to use, and was part of the Arboriculture expansion. The game was play tested extensively and works perfectly fine without the Grande Worker.

There was no error in my eyes. There was nothing wrong or nothing to feel responsible about. It was something that was part of an expansion that was deemed good enough to put in the base game (Like how Ports got added to the Second Edition of the Game of Thrones board game).

And I'm actually glad that they came out with the rules to be able to use with the first edition of the game, instead of having a second edition of the game come out 1 year later and saying "Oh, you want fun new options in the base game? Buy the second edition!"

Either way, I've played the first edition game more times than I've played many of the other board games that I own, and have never used the Grande Worker piece.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The game works perfectly fine without the Grande worker, and is extremely balanced and fun. I'd recommend simply making the Grande worker available as part of an expansion, which fans will then pick up for whatever the retail price for the expansion is. Anything else is silly and not necessary.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't have any clue what 1000 or so sets of 6 mega-meeples would cost to make... Meeplesource.com says they would retail for about $2000 total, or $2 per set. So maybe $1 per set to make? No idea, really.

My suggestion would be to hook up with the BGG store and sell them through the Geek for $5 or $6 per set, including shipping. People who wanted them could buy them, along with a nicely printed errata sheet (like the print and play one you put out on your site, but glossy and spiffy). People who are more crafty and sharpie up or dress up one of the starter meeples wouldn't have to.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since you are the publisher and this was not part of the original rules, I agree it's not feasible for you to give people additional workers. I think if you offer a reasonably priced upgrade, it will be fine. I wouldn't worry too much about it. In fact I'm sure I'll probably buy any extras you make for the game because I like it very much.

Sorry if I caused you concern. I'd be happy to update the post on my web site with information about the additional worker and how it can be obtained in the future.

Best wishes!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no way you should ship out Grande Workers, you can offer them on your website, for $X, and have the new edition come with them included.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sell them on your site, Include them in the next expansion, sell them here on BGG either way you are doing more than required of you. You can't make everybody happy all the time unfortunately but you can make them happy by allowing them to get the OPTIONAL workers through other means. If that doesn't make them happy then they are not worth making happy IMHO.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you all for sharing your thoughts! These are great ideas, and I appreciate the unfiltered feedback. I don't know much about how the BGG store works, but as long as I don't have to personally package 1300 sets of grande workers, I'm open to it. I'll check with Panda to see what they think about just doing a run of grandes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I do like the free convention hand-out idea. =)

And I know you were talking about offering an inexpensive add-on with the grandes in the second run...

But what is the possibility that this add-on could be free? Or at least, maybe the first set of grandes are a free add-on (selected in survey options) if a backer purchases any shippable item from the kickstarter. They could pay a small fee to add more than one set to their order if they'd bought multiple copies. And of course if the only thing they bought was the grandes then they'd have to pay the small fee in that case as well.

I'll buy the grandes no matter how it's organized, but I'd wager that offering the FREE add on for people who continue to support via kickstarter could be a feasible compromise while scoring points for customer service.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I use the chicken as the grande worker, EVEN THOUGH I have a set of grande workers. The chicken affords one an opportunity to make clucking noises, and is impossible to mistake for a normal worker, and you get to make clucking noises.

Did I mention the clucking noises?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I like the BGG store suggestion except for a detail - if somebody buys the Grande and later gets into the expansion KS, he'll wind up with two sets of Grandes (or a single set but no Arboriculture). I doubt it makes sense to you to offer a version of the expansion without the Grandes. I guess that as long as it's clearly stated, that should be no problem.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I plan on buying multiple sets of Takenoko so I can replace the grande worker with the gardeners. I,m sure my vines will show improvement!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think, between offering the Kickstarter and offering to sell the six grande workers by themselves, that's more than enough in terms of customer service, since the game is very functional as originally designed.

I also think you should choose a better word than "errata" to describe the changes, perhaps something like "updates" or "revisions". Errata refers to actual errors in the rules. If the rules had allowed you to both uproot and harvest in the same year with the yoke, and that was not what you intended, then correcting it qualify as errata. Offering better game play does not, and I think by using the word, it offers the wrong impression.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ellen--The grande workers could be free, but one question I posed earlier is: Does it make sense to you that someone who already has the grande workers (and paid for them in the original Kickstarter) should have to pay the same price as someone who bought the retail version and doesn't have the grandes?

I'm torn on that, especially since it was my decision to add the grandes to the base game after the retail version of the game was released without them. At the same time, original Kickstarter backers did pay for their grandes as part of the Arboriculture expansion.

I think the best solution may be a multifaceted approach including all of the following:

1. As planned, offer two versions of the expansion pack on Kickstarter: One with the grande worker and Arboriculture for those who didn't support the original Kickstarter campaign, and one without.

2. Make a bunch of extra grande workers and hand them out at conventions for free for people. I'll do this while dressed up as a grande worker.

3. Make a bunch of extra grande workers and send them to BGG to people who want to pay $5 for them now (including shipping).

Hopefully that will hit all the various groups of people involved here without offending anyone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric--That's a good point about errata. I guess I feel like it was my personal error to not include grandes in the base game in the first place. But you're right that it wasn't a typo or a misprint--the rules were printed as I intended, and the game was manufactured as I ordered it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your approach for the next expansion is a good one for sure! I want the Arboriculture expansion! I'd say stay the course.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hmm, this is quite a puzzle considering all possibilities, but I don't really see how somebody would be paying *just* for the Grandes twice. Let's see if I'm getting this straight.

According to the materials involved (base Viticulture, Grande Workers, and Arboriculture), there are 6 different products we're talking about. Three versions of Viticulture:

Just Viticulture. (VC 1st ed, KS & retail; no Grandes)
Viticulture + Arboriculture (VC Kickstarter version w/ expansion; includes Grandes)
Viticulture second edition (not yet ready, includes Grandes).

Two versions of the future KS expansion pack:

Tuscany with Arboriculture and Grandes (future KS)
Tuscany without AC or Grandes (future KS & retail)

And the extra pack of meeples we're talking about:

Pack of Grande Workers

either sold thru BGG, given away by Jamey in his dapper Grande costume or distributed through some other channel.

There are two sources of Grandes for people who don't yet have them (which would be owners of the retail or base-KS version of Viticulture, ). If the logistics for the pack () are solved, that would be a way. And you will also be able to get Grandes via (future Tuscany + Arboriculture KS), exclusively through Kickstarter, in which case you'll also get Arboriculture; the only problem is that you'll have to wait several months for it. All in all, I can only see a possibility of people paying twice for a set of Grandes: If somebody bought (1st ed Viticulture without the expansion) and gets both (the extra pack of Grande workers) and later (the KS version of Tuscany with Arboriculture).

But Arboriculture is KS-exclusive, so IMHO there is a significant difference between offering just the Grande Workers and the full Arboriculture pack. In both cases you are "completing" your 1st ed. Viticulture, but in the second you are also getting a full expansion. You're not paying twice for the Grandes as much as you are paying a little extra for Arboriculture.

[A corner case: Buying 2nd ed. Viticulture plus the Arboriculture version of Tuscany through the Tuscany KS could also result in two sets of Grandes, unless it's taken care of by offering a special "full" package for the Tuscany KS].

So:

If you have Viticulture without Grandes (), either KS or retail, and intend to get the expansions, the best course of action is waiting for the Tuscany KS, then getting the full Tuscany package including Arboriculture (). If you can't wait to get your awesome Grandes, you can get one of the Grande packs () as soon as they are available, then decide if you want with Arboriculture (in which case you'll need to get in the Kickstarter and will end up with an extra set of Grandes) or without (no problem there - you should be able to get it either through the KS or retail).

If you have Viticulture without Grandes () and you are not interested in the expansions, you can just go for the separate pack of Grandes (). If you ever decide you want the expansions, you'll be able to buy the retail version of Tuscany () - no Arboriculture for you, and thus no double Grandes.

If you have Viticulture with Arboriculture (), you're set. You might want to get Tuscany in the non-Arboriculture version (), which, I expect, will need a somewhat lower pledge than the with-Arboriculture version.

Wow, I hope I made some sense...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'd... actually pay for that if you allow me to take your picture.

I think that you might need to ensure that you are distributing the Grandes to people who have actually bought VC - otherwise, they will not last long (they make for a pretty nice collectible, specially with a price of 'free'). Other than that, that seems like a good solution.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's also a good solution. If it's feasible, it might be a good idea to distribute also the Grande packs along with the regular Tuscany, priced for cheap (perhaps $2-$3), so that people with the first edition can also get them from more local sources.

Cheers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From my point of view there's absolutely no issue here and no one has anything to complain about. You created a great game, produced it and put it up for sale.

That you then make an optional new version of the rules that requires players [b]who choose to use them[/i] to scrounge components from another game or be creative with the existing components (e.g. put a grape token next to a normal worker, or place him on a lira counter) is not an error on your part - on the contrary it's damn great customer service that you provide updates after the game is finished.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1035460:
Is it allowed to place more than one of your workers on a given location? For instance, you place a worker on Build A Structure. Your turn comes back around and there is still a spot available to place a worker in the Build A Structure location. Can you place another of your workers there? We played that you WERE ALLOWED to do this. Did we make a mistake?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As long as you respect player number limits I believe it is allowed as long as you can actually perform the action. For example you have to actually plant if you take that action you can't take the action to block someone else out.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We play that you can put your worker on any space on your turn as long as it's valid for you to do so. So yeah, if in a previous turn, you put a worker on a spot and it comes back to your turn and the spot is still open, you can go there and do the action.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Josh and Sarah. You two are correct. Feasibly in a 5- or 6-player game, a single player could end up taking all of the wine tour action (for example) over the course of the summer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Playing with Grande workers I have played 3 workers at 1 location in a 4 player game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scott--Definitely, that's allowed by the rules.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, so in a 2-player game can I use my Grande worker to take an action twice (again), but without the middle bonus since it would be using the "overtaking" or a smaller worker rule? Or do I have this idea completely wrong to begin with?

Edit: Reference: "First Edition Errata: The grande worker can take the bonus from a middle action space even if it’s not on that space (and even in a 2-player game, in which you usually don’t have access to the middle action space bonus). You can also use the grande worker to use an action that is already full. If you use him in that way, you do not get the middle action space bonus."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strickhouser--I think you answered your own question, but if not, let me know.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sort of just looking for a confirmation I guess. If, in a 2-player game, I take an action with a regular worker can I take said action again with my Grande worker? If so, I would be allowed to take it, but without a bonus correct?

It seems straight forward, but being able to take an action twice seemed like I could be abusing the rules, while using a Grande worker to take an action already taken by another player seems like the intention of the Grande worker. Again, all in a 2-player game...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To people reading this comment in the present: The grande rules I describe below are quite outdated. The current rules are that the grande worker can (a) be used as a regular worker, with all regular worker rules or (b) they can be placed next to an action if all available action spaces are full to let you take that action. That's it.

Here's the comment from the past:

Strickhouser--That's correct. So, in a two-player game, if you place a regular worker on the "give vineyard tour" space, you would gain 2 lira. When it's your turn again, you can place your grande worker on that action (not on an action space) and also gain 2 lira.

An alternative option would be that instead of placing the regular worker on the one available action space in the 2-player game, you would instead place your grande worker on that action space and gain 3 lira (2 for the action, 1 for the bonus).

You can only use the grande worker (or any worker, for that matter) once per year, so you have to decide how to best position him.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perfect answer. Thank you!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This same question came up in our first game which involved multiple spaces per action being available (3P, 1st edition rules). After consulting the rulebook in vain and after some deliberation, we decided that placing multiple workers of the same player on the same action in one year was not allowed.

In retrospect, I'm not sure why we interpreted the scenario that way as it makes more sense to allow the move. Thanks for the clarification, Jamey.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Devin. I'm sorry to first edition rulebook wasn't clear about that. As long as an action space is open, you can place a worker there.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This thread answered a burning question I had about whether, in a 2 player game, you could effectively take an action twice using the grande meeple.

However, I noticed a couple of people in the thread refer to using the grande meeple to take the middle space bonus.

Is this another errata to the errata? I can't find any mention of this rule on the Viticulture 2nd edition page (http://www.stonemaiergames.com/second-edition-viticulture/) and the quick guide explicitly states that the grande meeple cannot be used to take the middle space bonus (https://app.box.com/s/u0vmdn7o0sv2mv3g2far).

So what's the official, correct version of the rules?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The grande worker was not available in the base game for the first edition of Viticulture.

The grande worker was first introduced as a part of Aboriculture. On page 3 of the rules for Aboriculture, it says the grande worker allows you to get the bonus for them middle space, even when you are not occupying the middle space.

The guide and summary to the first edition "errata" (or second edition rules, if you prefer) give the grande worker the additional ability to use the normal action, even when all the spaces for that action are filled. This will be an official part of the second edition rules.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Eric - so given I'm not playing with the Aboriculture expansion, the latter would be the "official" way to play?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric and Steven: Good question, and thanks for helping out, Eric. The grande worker is an official part of Viticulture now. He can be treated like a regular worker, but his one ability is that you can put him on an action that's already full of other workers. If you use him that way, he doesn't gain the bonus from that action. But if you place him like a regular worker on an action space that has a bonus, you get the bonus like any worker would.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Jamey - does placing the grande on a normal action space earn you the bonus even in a 2P game?

I'm sure you're aware of this, but just a heads up that the rules posted on the website don't state this rule.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steven--No, you only gain the bonus from the grande (or any worker) if it's on the action space with the bonus.

Thanks for pointing that out. I added the last line to the paragraph about the grande worker:

It may be placed on an already full action to perform that action. For example, if you are playing a 2-player game and the other player chooses to give a tour with regular worker to gain 2 lira. If you really needed to give a tour, you may then place the grande worker on that action (on the art for that action, not an action space) to gain 2 lira as well. Multiple players may place their grande workers in this way. Otherwise you may place your grande worker on any action as you would place a regular worker there.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perfect - all makes sense to me now! Thanks very much for taking the time to explain!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you combine Viticulture 2nd edition with Aboriculture, does the grande worker have both abilities? Or will there also be a change to the Aboriculture rules?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric: Good question. When playing Arboriculture, the grande worker does indeed have both abilities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My wife and I have played a lot of viticulture over the past few weeks and we've decided that we prefer to house rule that you can't take an action twice in the 2 player game by using the grande worker.

I think worker placement games like Viticulture thrive on scarcity and competition for action, forcing you to plan ahead and prioritise, otherwise there's very little tension.

Being able to take the same action twice seemed to decrease the strategy and planning required for us, and being able to play 2 visitors of the same type (summer or winter) seemed to be a particularly powerful option.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hello

from the text: "Multiple players may place their grande workers in this way"

This means that, let say in a 6 player game, a location may end with 6 workers (3 standard and 3 Grande ones)?

thanks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It could end with 9: 3 standard, and all 6 Grande.

This is going to be pretty short, because I don't know how to talk about specifics without spoiling what I've done

I had a game yesterday with my girlfriend, where I played with er...Lets call it the 'L' expansion and Arboriculture together with the base game. I took an approach in the game of ignoring loyalty and focusing on building some infrastructure over worrying about how many points I had. As always I also went for a 2 field approach and ignored my third, Grace used all 3. I think that in a 2/4/6 player game it's only worth it to have 2, because the 'x2 Harvest' spot is at such a premium that you can rarely hit all 3.

I actually got quite lucky with my strategy, as I got a 'trade VP for money' card, and used it to drop myself from the -2 I had to -5 to go up to 9 Lira, this let me get all the buildings I wanted to fuel myself into the game. Grace tried to vie for keeping her loyalty up and discarded a lot of wine that way, but was sitting on about 5 VP while I had -5.

I hoarded quite a lot of winter visitors as the game continued, in preparation for late game. I also managed to get my cellar complete and practically full from 5 through 9 in white & red, with a token in sparkling too, Graces cellar stayed fairly sparse, with her just aiming to hit particular orders. In the last 3 years, I made use of winter visitors and the fill order space to get from -5 to 25 points, while Grace only reached about 13. I think another year before going for my plan, or if Grace had realised to take first place and block the winter visitor spots and I'd have lost.

It was a fun game, although as I said there's lots of details missing. Something I've come to realise, is that the stickers in the Viticulture kickstarter edition are awesome, and my expansion now bears a couple of them =) I also learned to appreciate how hard it can be to ensure elements see some use, as only about half of the additions I made got touched upon. I can't wait to try it out some more now that I've put some balancing changes in, and can tweak what cards we use =)

Ok this is a bit of a useless report...but oh well ;-D
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You've piqued my interest, Chris. I look forward to seeing what you've created!

Also, that's a brilliant use of the stickers. I never thought they would be used for that, but now I'm glad we included them!

Got my first play in with Arboriculture =)

Playing with a friend - Ken, who's played before, so I decided we could add in Arboriculture and see how it goes.

We played with the Grande Worker having the ability to use a space that's already been taken.

For the first few turns, I opted to go last to get an extra worker, as I was happy to just go on a tour and grab some money when I wasn't able to build or suchlike. My general tactic for the game was to try and avoid needing to use the Grande worker 'just' to get a spot, and instead use it for the middle-spot abilities. I also opted to keep my fields simple, and for the first half of the game had just 2 fields, 1 with a pinot & 1 with a 2-white and 1 tomato. I kept my workers loyal by giving them white wine for most years, as my first few orders barely needed it.

On Kens' first few turns, he often got to go first, and took the opportunity to gather a lot of vines and get them planted. Although I got my first extra worker before him, he rushed those around the middle game and maxed out first (Not sure if I ever got a 6th actually). He also filled up all 3 fields, which I didn't bother to do in a 2-player game as harvesting 3 seemed a waste of actions compared to other opportunites. Ken also got the first couple of orders in, as he was lucky enough to get low value orders (My orders were roughly mid-range). He also got an olive planted which I think he opted to use for worker loyalty at some point.

In the middle of the game, I tried to save up a fair bit of cash and upgrading my cellar to max ahead of Ken so that I'd be able to fill my higher orders. I also picked up a tasting room, and mostly went for first place after that to take tours and get a VP each turn. I got my first order done - a 5r/3w that I'd picked up and got myself some steady income.

Ken for the most part ignored his workers loyaly through the middle of the game, and let his workers drop to the bottom, I presume hoping to make up for it with filling orders with the wine he'd gathered. I kept it just above the minimum, but made sure that I used my yoke and/or the harvest action every turn to keep myself with enough stock to get away with using wine. I also ended up with 2 tomato fields, which I kept for gaining VP instead of making my workers happy, I think all 3 or 4 orders of the game I filled had some Tomato Sauce attached.

Towards the end of the game, I got a couple of useful card draws (Like fill an order, which I love for making up for the other player taking the fill action ahead of you), Ken was less lucky and had 3 'get an extra worker' cards when he'd maxed out before getting them. While I was fairly behind early on as I struggled to fill orders, in the late game all my lowly wine tokens had managed to mature which let me get a lot of orders completed and charge out into the lead. Something quite interesting was that I only actually got to 4 on residual payments, while Ken was on 5, but I had a lot more VP.

Anyway, I managed to wine the game with about 22ish to 12ish. I think Ken's choice to let the workers by unhappy was a major mistake, and that it helped me out a lot to keep them satisfied. I also quite like that I managed to get away with barely planting anything and letting the grapes mature, it works very well when doing blush orders due to adding the values together ^^

So I had a lot of fun playing, and I really like what the Arboriculture expansion adds. It was a bit of a shame that the only arbors I got in the game were 2 tomatos but that's just the way it goes =P I found the cask quite a cool addition, as it helps with getting an order prepped and filled. In fact one of the components for my final order was a 7 blush that I +1's in the summer ready for the winter sale!

Now I just need to print off the super-secret expansion contest en...I've said too much, bye!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I really like your game descriptions, Chris. They always seem so action-packed! Glad to hear you liked Arboriculture.

Tuscany! Land of grape and vine! You are a vineyard owner tasked with improving your winery. Construct new buildings, attract influential visitors, and build your prestige through growing, crushing, and bottling delicious grapes. But watch out! While Tuscany is a beautiful place to live, it is a competitive place to work.

Can your vineyard outshine all others? Find out in Viticulture!

How It Works
Viticulture is a worker placement game for two to six players. Players are vineyard owners in Tuscany and compete to earn victory points by making wine and filling wine orders. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each player starts the game with three workers, three lira (the game's currency), a pinot vine card, and a barebones personal vineyard mat. Each game round comprises one year at the vineyard, and play follows four seasons:

Spring: Players choose their wake-up time (turn order) and receive benefits

Summer: Players assign workers to complete summer actions

Fall: Players receive one visitor card (summer or winter)

Winter: Players assign workers to complete winter actions

When choosing a wake-up time, players balance the benefits offered versus the benefit of going first in each season. There is no benefit for going first, for example, and going last provides the benefit of using an extra worker for the year.

Summer actions include things like drawing and planting vine cards, building structures (which increase player abilities at their vineyard), selling grapes and giving tours (both for lira), and playing summer visitor cards. Winter actions include things like drawing and filling wine order cards, harvesting fields, crushing grapes into wine, training new workers, and playing winter visitor cards. Each action area (both summer and winter) has limited spaces for players to choose, and the center space in each area includes a bonus for the player who chooses it. Unlike other worker placement games, however, a player must be able to fully utilize a space in order to claim it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Visitor cards grant players one-time special abilities or extra actions, many times either boosting an action or providing a more efficient way to accomplish an action. They are central to the game.

At the end of the year, grapes and wine age (increasing in value), players receive money for wine orders filled throughout the game, players discard down to seven cards, and the first-player marker rotates counter-clockwise.

The game ends at the end of the year whenever one player reaches 20 points. Whoever has the most points is the winner.

Wine Making or Whine Making?
The worker placement genre is crowded and seems to get more crowded by the con. So how does the newcomer Viticulture stand up against the others? While Viticulture is probably not my favorite worker placement game (Agricola is hard to topple), I think it's a worthy title, especially given its novel theme and production value.

Viticulture is a beautiful game. When it's on the table, it is stunning. The artwork is evocative, the pieces look great--everything about it gives it a fantastic table presence. But the components aren't just beautiful, they're also functional. The central board and each player board are double-sided. One side is just the artwork with icons for reminders; the other side has text explaining what each space allows, along with a year order list. This is a great idea, and I wish other publishers would follow this model. I was playing in one game with a player who kept asking questions, and we found out his board was turned to the art-only side. Once we corrected him, there were no more questions about what buildings or spaces did. I find there are often questions when teaching a game; I love that Stonemaier Games has aided teaching as much as possible through the board design.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The components themselves, aside from their look, are very nice. The wood pieces feel a bit hollow, but I pretend they're made of cork. There's also nothing to complain about here, since each building that can be constructed has its own unique shape. The glass beads for grapes and wine are great, especially for keeping track of age. The central and player boards are on excellent stock, and I love the matte finish. The lira are perhaps the standout in the components. They look and feel so great that I'm tempted to transport them with other games to replace money or victory chits.

There are only a few things to quibble over in the components: the box size and shape and the cards. The box size fits the game well, but it's nonstandard. Because of this it doesn't really fit on my game shelf very well. The cards are the tiny Euro ones. Not my favorite, but the benefit is that they easily fit on the main board (less table space!). I'm not a huge fan of the cardstock, but this is my frequent gripe with this particular manufacturer, and I think I'm more sensitive to this than most others. You can safely ignore my curmudgeonly views on this once again.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Speaking of the cards, they are the beating heart of Viticulture, especially the summer and winter visitors. After all, what good is a winery if people don't visit? The summer and winter cards offer some variation on the actions available during those seasons, with some twists. Some give you access to actions at a discount. Some give you access to two actions for greater efficiency. Some give you more money, a greater benefit, or the opportunity for a fantastic benefit, but at a cost. If these abilities seem all over the board, they are. In fact, this is one of the criticisms leveled against Viticulture: the cards are too variable in abilities and too swingy for a game of this kind. My take on this is that yes, the cards are swingy, but dealing with this is part of the game. And when I teach the game, I am sure to warn players that the visitor cards are very important and can't be neglected. (The same warning accompanies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
, but no one seems to listen to me...) While there's more luck in drawing cards in Viticulture, I don't think it's game-breaking luck. But players who are luck averse may not like this aspect of the game.

Despite the luck of the cards, the game feels tight. Action spaces open up depending on the number of players, but the actions are always more scarce than you want them to be. Most of the time this is good since it rewards players for properly budgeting their workforce and keeps decisions tense, giving the game immediacy. However, toward the end, it can also make the game feel anticlimactic. Viticulture is not a "multiple paths to victory" kind of game. Yes, you can score victory points doing lots of things, but the main way, the consistent way to score big is to make and sell wine (as it should be: you're managing a Tuscan vineyard, for crying out loud). The only way to fill orders (outside of visitor cards that let you do so), though, is by claiming the "fill orders" space on the board, limited, again, based on the number of players. In each game I've played, the game has been tense until the final round, when one player fills their last order--and the other players can do nothing about it, either because the order spaces are filled or there are no more ways to score points and catch up. (It's similar in this regard to Power Grid, another "racing" game that often ends in anticlimax.) Playing the game to the end of the year seems like crawling across the finish line. I know that this probably isn't always how the game ends, but the scarcity in the last round and the limited action spaces has made for some sour endings to otherwise sweet games.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Of course, the cards can be instructive here. The difference between an experienced player and a rookie player of Viticulture is timing. Rookie players want to play their best cards immediately. Veteran players know that a situation is coming when they will greatly need the assistance of their visitors, and they plan accordingly to maximize their efficiency. See? I told you those cards were important. All of the fill order spaces are blocked? There's a visitor for that.

Returning to the sweetness of Viticulture, one aspect I like is the game's laid-back nature. Yes, I know, I just said that the game is tense (and it is), but let's be realistic: no one dies if you play poorly (a reality you'd rather not face in Agricola or Stone Age), and you don't have to feed anybody. Workers trained stay with you. You aren't penalized for waking up early (aside from not receiving a bonus), you don't go into debt, and generally the visitors are bearers of goodwill toward your vineyard. The game is tense, but the theme of the game helps bring players back to a place of calm.

Perhaps my favorite aspect of Viticulture is its representation of time. Lots of games rely on timing--and so does Viticulture--but Viticulture also carefully depicts the flow of time. Each round represents one year, and each year is broken into four seasons. Only certain actions are available, depending on the season, and workers spent in the summer stay spent for the year--that is, each player must budget their workers wisely so as to last them the year. Vines are planted in the summer and harvested in the winter, and grapes and wine age from year to year. I love the way time naturally flows in this game and how players must plan to use time to their advantage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a similar vein, players choose turn order by assigning a wake-up time to their workers. The early bird gets the worm, but that's about all the early bird gets. Late risers get the leftover actions, but they also get a bonus--sometimes a pretty hefty bonus. However, player order cannot be underestimated in Viticulture. The competition for the top spots on the board can be cutthroat, and so the extra edge of going first is a huge boon, especially when the bonus spaces are in play. I should mention that the wake-up track appeared in
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
, another worker placement game, but I like its use much better here. In Fresco wake up was tied to worker morale and prices for paint, and these extra considerations complicated it for me in a way I didn't like. In effect, players were choosing the best negative; in Viticulture the choice is between various good things, and I like this better.

There is one thing in Viticulture that was a huge disappointment to me: the time it takes to play the game. The Stonemaier Games website advertises 60 minutes (and the box says 45-90 minutes), and I was quite excited when I saw this, as my most frequent gaming opportunities arrive in one-hour chunks. But even the two-player game lasted much longer than even the low estimate. While I think it's conceivable to get the two-player game down to sixty minutes with time and practice, I can't imagine playing with six, or four, or even three in less than ninety minutes. The board is manageable by being broken into seasons, so options won't overwhelm new players, but each move still requires calculation, especially since workers must be budgeted for the full year. Familiarity will reduce player time, but there are still plenty of decisions to be weighed. Maybe I and all of my opponents are more deliberate players than most, but we all agreed that sixty minutes seemed more wishful than actual. This isn't really a downside to the game so much as a disappointment. It fills its ninety minutes to two-hour game time well and doesn't overstay its welcome. It's meaty enough to merit the time spent. It's just that I doubt even with experience you'll be able to fit the game in an hour with more than two players.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Also, a word on the two-player game. The game works okay with two players, though I don't think this is the best player count. Part of the problem is the scarcity of spaces mentioned earlier: just one space for each action is available, so once taken, the other player is out of luck. This can make it hard to catch up (though I think the game is balanced well enough that this isn't a huge concern). Catching up is easier with the bonus action space, which usually lets players accomplish more than the regular space, but the bonus space only opens up once three players are in. There's a variant on the Stonemaier Games page that suggests using the grande worker from the Kickstarter expansion to allow players in the two-player game access to the bonus spaces. However, the grande worker is not included in the retail package, and so I was unable to test this out.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All told, Viticulture is a very nice worker placement game, one of the better ones I've played. I'm not a wine aficionado, so the theme, while pleasant, didn't do anything for me, but the gameplay was enough to keep me engrossed. A few of the aspects I mentioned above can be frustrating if you don't plan for them; I think they work fine as another thing players must be prepared for. This game looks great, plays smoothly, and offers good tension without players being overwhelmed by penalties. There's enough novel here to merit play, even if you have a lot of worker placement games, and enough familiar to allow experienced players to jump in quick. (I wouldn't recommend this as a casual game.) Viticulture is a good game, dripping with theme: I recommend that you drain your glass and request another.

***NOTE: After this review was first published, the designer brought my attention to some proposed changes for the second edition. I've not tried these, but they seem to address my concerns.

This review originally appeared on iSlaytheDragon.com. iSlaytheDragon received a review copy of this game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good review and the proposed changed do indeed address your concerns. I too had some concerns and I have played with the proposed changes and it makes the game amazing!

Also on you last sideways picture. I have had that problem before as well. An easy work around is to rotate it in a paint program or something like that and then taking a screen shot of the rotated picture
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just stick the 'grande meeple' on a slip of paper when you place it. Problem solved. Without the grande meeple, the two player is not good.

Nice review.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Or just right click the file and select "Rotate Clockwise"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks so much for the review! I really appreciate you all take the time to play my game, and I look forward to sharing the expanded world of Tuscany with you when we release the expansion pack in 2014!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very nice review! Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I really would buy this game but having missed it at the KS stage I feel I've missed out on all the bonuses and extras.

Therefore, I just can't bring myself to pay for a game that I'd always know was lacking and 'second-best' in some way...

I guess that a perennial problem with KS games
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martyn--I hear your concern, and it was my fault for offering gameplay exclusives through the original Kickstarter campaign. All Kickstarter exclusives will be available through the Kickstarter project for the expansion pack, which will include opportunities to get the full KS second edition of the game.

However, if you're interested in the game and have an opportunity to get it now, I would recommend that you do so. That way when you get the expansion pack (which will include everything that you feel like you missed out on by not supporting the original Kickstarter) next summer, it will be something new to add to a game that you've been able to play over the last year. Otherwise you'll have to wait until then to get the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the advice and the reply. That's certainly a good option to consider.

Huge kudos to you on creating such a fascinating and aesthetically-pleasing game. Even my wife likes the look of it and she is usually very ambivalent about boardgames...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Martyn! I'm glad that the game is appealing to people who normally wouldn't care about board games.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Honestly, the Kickstarter add-ons are not that great, apart from the expansion (although I haven't tried it yet). The coasters, bag, slip case, portrait sheet are all totally unnecessary.

Game 4 of Viticulture was...interesting.

So at the end of July I went to visit my girlfriend, Grace, before she went away on holiday for a few weeks with her Dad, to hang out and meet her Dad, Michael for the first time. She hadn't played it yet and decided that her Dad might find the game interesting, so she invited him for it, I decided to let it happen to see how it might go despite suspecting the game might be a bit complex ^^

Fortunately, I was in a particularly good mood, so I was happy to be extremely patient throughout the game (I don't think Grace was so impressed ). This has definitely been my longest game of Viticulture, and I had to go over things a lot of times for Michael!

- For the start of the game, I decided to go for vines first after I ended up 1st place from Spring on the vine card place, which is a first as usually if I do that in the first couple of years someone takes the '1' spot ^^. Knowing the build place would be heavily contested early on, I got my Trellis built, as did Grace behind me, leaving Michael very confused what to do. As it happened I went through all his available actions, trying to put emphasis on what help him each turn. He went for a tour to get some money when I pointed out that by rushing buildings, we had little money for workers in winter.

- As the game went on, Michael very much played to the theme. He got all his fields maximized on vines, and often went for money over other options out of making a profit from his business, he also got his maximum workers by halfway through the game (Which made helping him on actions difficult, as he had more than I could explain useful things for most rounds ). Grace stuck with quite a small number of workers for most of the game, but used what she had to get plenty of grapes/vines ready for filling later, she unfortunately got difficult orders to fill as her first draws, so it took her a while to get going. For me I was quite lucky getting low value orders. I managed to get to $2 residual payments and 8VP before the others moved off the track (Grace was on -1VP from a card she had played).

= Something that was quite difficult for Michael was reading the cards he had. The text is quite small and he often had to hold the cards very close to his face to read them, and then ask me anyway to work out what it did Small text is fine by me but it's a shame for it to be difficult for some to manage.

- A few rounds on, I was sitting on about 17, Michael on 10, Grace on ~5 VP. Michael had made all of his grapes into just red/white wine and had them sitting there somewhat unusable, Grace had gotten the hang of the game by then, and was working out how to catch up with us. (Should probably remember I was advising Michael but Grace was managing things herself through the game, she learns fast so preffered pursuing her own options I think). At this point I could have grabbed the victory, but I was quite interested in how the others were playing, and I was hoping I might find a way to hit the 25 marker when I won =P

- In the final round, Grace jumped into 2nd place, making great use of all the wine she'd been making at lower values to age and fill orders (Whether deliberate or by chance I have no idea, but I presume deliberate ), I completely messed up my plan and finished at about 22, and Michael only managed to garner about ~1VP as we blocked him from filling orders in that year.

= I didn't enjoy the game as much as usual, but I did find it a surprisingly nice experience to teach someone who was completely outside the realms of gaming to it anyway. It takes a long time to work out how to help someone without influencing their strategies, but I think I did a pretty good job, as in fact he often did completely unexpected things which hurt his chances a bit, but as I said earlier, was certainly thematic =P. I hope I can get Grace to play when she's back from the pennines and after our Scotland trip, so I can more closely observe how she goes about playing Viticulture too.

Chris out =P
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for teaching Viticulture to a non-gamer! Having taught the game hundreds of times by this point, I relish games when I don't have to teach and can just go all-out in an attempt to win. That's given me a higher appreciation for people like you who are willing to teach the game to others. Thank you!

As the lucky winner of this competition, I'd like to give a big THANK YOU to both Roger and Jamey for this. I am really looking forward to playing this game, which is in short supply here in the UK.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Andrew! You should have the game soon.

Who wants to play a game about wine making? Well, my board game playing chums, you’re in luck because straight off the top of my head I can name at least three games from the last few years that try to simulate the gathering, production and selling aspects of high-octane wine making –
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
and
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. Of those, Vinhos is the deepest, most complex and nicely balanced – offering a thematic, yet tight and challenging business simulation of creating a wine empire. Today, however, we’re going to talk about Viticulture – the newly kickstarted worker placement game from first time publisher Stonemaier Games. In comparison to Vinhos, Viticulture is much earthier, agricultural, and concerned with the practical growing and crushing of grapes. It is also a significantly lighter experience, but is it a fine vintage, or a tainted and corked disgrace! Enough of the wine-y puns…to the review!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whilst looking for a not too paltry $25,000 to fund, Viticulture smashed that initial goal and in October of 2012 finished its fund raising sprint at over $65k. A well-managed campaign, featuring temping stretch goals to upgrade the in-box components was like nectar to a swarm of bees as 942 gamers threw their money at this fledgling company. Some 9 months later, and thanks to what some call ‘production’ and I call magic, I have a copy in my hands. Now I bought mine through my friendly, local retailer so didn’t get the ‘Exclusive Kickstarter Extras’ so won’t be commenting on the deck of Arboriculture cards – though reports on ‘the geek’ suggest that they do add to the experience.

Viticulture is all about the nuts and bolts of planting, growing and harvesting grapes, then crushing, maturing and then selling the finished wine. Refreshingly, it’s a simple race to twenty victory points – and there are many (an almost Feldian amount) of ways to score. Mechanically, this is a literal ‘worker placement game’ and is split into four seasons – Spring, Summer, Fall (a new one on me, but whatever) and Winter.

The Spring mechanism is stolen (with all due credit given by the designers) from Queen Games’ Fresco. Players choose at what time they will ‘wake up’– and the relative choices of the players will denote turn order for the following seasons. There are increasingly helpful bonuses available for the later risers, but perhaps going first is more important to you. Nice choices – well implemented.

Summer is the first proper phase as players place their workers on board spaces to do ‘stuff.’ This could be buy, plant or sell grapes, receive ‘Summer Guests’ (more on that later) and build structures on your personal player board. You can even give tours around your farm for a few quick bucks / Lira. These actions are limited as per the number of players – one available space per action for 2 player games, up to three available spaces for 5 – 6 player games. This scales the game well, but does mean that a 6 player game (for instance) is a lot meaner and fiercely competitive than a 5 player game as there are simply less spaces to go around.

Autumn, erm… Fall allows players to draw another Summer or Winter guest. That’s it. Winter is the 2nd worker placement phase – the twist being that only workers that you didn’t use in the Summer are available here. This forces players to ration this resource over a year and leads to some more interesting, and tough decisions.

Winter is all about harvesting your grapes, and crushing those into Wines, plus accepting those useful Winter guests. This is also the only chance to draw and later fulfil order cards – the primary method of scoring victory points. At the end of a full year, all the wine and grapes improve in quality by one – a nice thematic touch – meaning that producing that quality one white grape becomes well worth the investment as the years tick by.

So we’re growing grapes, turning it into wine and filling orders to score points. Rinse and repeat until one player gets at least 20 victory points at turn end and then they are the winner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What makes Viticulture stand out? Well, I enjoy the cut throat nature of the worker placement – particularly with 2, 4 and 6 players. A cursory glance at your opponent’s board will indicate if they are desperate to plant or harvest this year. Blocking those spots is a valid and highly entertaining tactic. I also love how everything connects thematically – and the planting, growing, harvesting cycle transfers what could be quite abstract mechanics into something which simply makes sense.

The ‘Guests’ have been discussed as a bone of contention amongst early adopters and I understand many of the complaints. Guests cards allow players to take additional actions, add features to their farm and, perhaps most controversially, earn victory points for certain criteria. They are also incredibly varied in how useful they are – and this effectiveness is highly dependent on your current circumstances. Now, it would be possible to change your strategy based on cards drawn – to take advantage of what they offer – though like redirecting a particularly stubborn mule, this shift of strategy can be difficult and time consuming and is often simply not worth it. Other players receiving the cards at a better time, or ones that match a current strategy will have an advantage and this could be seen as a problem. That said, they do add a great deal of flavour to proceedings and make each play different – as long as you are willing to appreciate the lucky swings that they inherently offer – which I do.

I couldn’t finish this off without talking about the bits. Due to the vast amount of over-funding sloshing about this kickstarter, the company decided to add wooden meeples for just about everything. Getting up token? How about a wooden Cockerel? Add a medium cellar to your farm? Small wooden house for that! Built the large cellar? Slightly bigger wooden house coming up! Now having so many unique meeples is unnecessary, but does make it more fun to play.

But should you buy it? If you have room for a medium weight Euro in your collection that plays from two to six – then yes! Even without the absurd amount of over produced pieces, Viticulture would be a fun, solid and entertaining game. The very attractive board, player mats and plethora of wooden bits only add to this experience and make it a more fun experience. With the proviso that the random guest cards can leave you at a disadvantage compared to the other players, I found Viticulture to be a very satisfying tipple. This is a full bodied and fruity game: Fresh, aromatic and well-balanced on the palate… erm tabletop.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very nice review! I also enjoy the game and recommend it, I was one of the people that Kickstarted it and I am glad I did!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the comment. With this and Vinhos, I am now the Little Metal Dog Show wine game expert... which could come back to hurt me. Winemaking Munchkin anyone?

Jamey,

I am curious if you have plans regarding the four visitor cards that are in the KickStarter edition (Volunteer Crew, Wedding Party, Guest Speakers, Caravan according to http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/140045/viticultu...).

Will they be considered a part of Aboriculture, and available if you buy that Second Edition?

Will they be in a different expansion?

Will they be considered exclusive to the first KickStarter, a bonus for your initial backers?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A mini expansion consisting of four additional Visitor cards; two summer (Wedding Party and Volunteer Crew) and two winter (Caravan and Guest Speakers), made available exclusively to backers of the Kickstarter project. These cards potentially provide extra options otherwise not available in the base game.

That is from the description. I have the KS edition and wouldn't care if they were released. Just my $0.02
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1011564:
This is a variant I will almost certainly apply in all my games with my partner from here on. I like Viticulture as a 2p but I feel that I'm 'missing out' on some part of the game due to the unavailability of the bonus spaces.

I also have the regular retail version of the game, and while I could easily proxy a Grande Worker I like that this variant adds some level of decision due to the drawback of using the bonus spot.

Anyway, here is how it works...

When placing a worker on an action space that has not yet been claimed this turn players have the choice to use the 'solid' yellow or blue spot (the one normally only opened up with 5-6 players). If they do then that works exactly as in the base game rules, and no other player (including himself) can place additional workers on that action that year.

The alternative is for the player to claim the bonus spot, as in 3-6 player games, but there is a catch. If they do then the other player, when they take their turn, can place a worker on the left most spot for that action (the 1-2 player spot described page 6 of the rules). The player with the worker on the bonus space cannot use that action a second time later in the season however.

So essentially, this variant introduces the possibility for players to get a little more from their placement, but they have to weight that against the possibly more beneficial 'blocking' move of their opponent off a particular action that year.

Again I don't think the designer choices to make the game the way he chose to is wrong, I just feel that this particular variant will work better both for me and my partner, by speeding up the game a tiny bit (we are not very prone to AP, so the extra layer of decision is a non-issue for us). See what you think...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That is Interesting.

We have played a variant (accidentaly as it turns out)
that the workers -must- be played in sequence from left to right.
Thus: Tension was added in that a decision to place a worker early opens up the Bonus spot to the opponent.

To be honest: we thought that was how the game was "supposed" to be played,
and I was suprised (and a little disappointed) to discover that one could always place a worker on the Bonus spot first.
Our 'mistake' actually makes a two=player game much more interesting IMO.

I'll have to try your variant and see how that changes the 'feel'...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1011559:
Here's a variant I have thought of trying, in case anyone wants to give it a go with their group.

In the Fall, instead of drawing random cards, give the last player in turn order a number of summer visitor cards equal to the number of players as well as that same number of winter visitor cards.

That player then chooses one card of the type of his choice to add to his hand and discards a card of the other type at random. He then passes the remaining cards to the next player in reverse wake-up chart turn order.

The Cottages still work as before and the extra cards must be drawn (at random, from whichever visitor pile the player chooses) before the drafting.

Needless to say that this variant can add a LOT of play time if players are not seasoned Viticulture players or are prone to AP, but I think it can be an interesting way to make both Spring and Fall of every year as much a strategic phase of the game as the other 2.

Anyway, feel free to comment... and as usual I will state that when I post a variant it is NOT because I think there is a problem with the game in the first place, I just like to try different ways to play my games and hopefully find something useful that may suit better a group I introduce games to.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think I like that!

Hilo ID 1010866:
My husband and I got together with two friends to game on a hot Saturday afternoon. We started off with a nicely chilled serving of Viticulture… Yeah, not sure if that analogy worked since I don’t drink wine, but I certainly felt the game was refreshing compared to previous plays. The reason – we played with new rules that the designers wanted people to test out to possibly be included in the second edition of the game. Overall, I say the changes fix quite a few of the issues we have with the game.

Let’s start with the rule changes.

Grande Worker: This worker is currently part of the Arboriculture expansion and gives a player the ability to take a bonus action when not on the bonus space. The proposed change is that this worker would be standard in the base game, everyone starting with him and 2 regular workers, but that he could also be placed on a full action space to take that action.

Making Wine: In the current rules, when you crush grapes you only make one type of wine. This was not always easy to explain and when it was understood, it really slowed down the game. As it was, my husband and I always viewed the +1 bonus as allowing you to crush more than one type of wine, when it was supposed to be that you increased the value of the wines by 1. However, we liked the way we played it since it didn’t slow things down as much. The new proposed rules are that you make 3 wine tokens when you crush and the bonus +1 space allows you to make one additional wine token.

End Game Scoring: In the current rules, you have no end game scoring which leads to many games fizzling out in the winter because there are no more viable ways to earn VP so there’s no reason to take any more actions even if you have workers left. The proposed changes add two ways to earn VP at the end of the game: 10 lira=1 VP and 4 wine tokens=1 VP.

Visitor Cards: There have been a lot of complaints of some visitor cards being over or under powered. So we kept an eye on the cards we came across. The only one that we felt was unbalanced was the Entertainer, which costs too many workers to use. You have to set aside 4 workers for the year and give up 2 wine tokens to earn 4 VP. It should cost 2 workers instead of 4 so it can be played from the beginning of the game. In some games, players never get to the5 workers needed to play the card – 1 worker to take the play visitor action space and then 4 to set aside. In this game, no one had 5 workers and it has only happened a few times in previous games.

How Did People React During the Game
In previous games, most players expressed frustration constantly through the game. This was especially true when we taught it to new players. For this game, with the above changes, there was very little frustration expressed and our two friends were new to the game. There was some awe expressed when someone played some great visitor cards, but when it came to the action spaces, no one was completely blocked from doing at least one useful action per year. Everyone’s Grande Worker got a workout, either being used for the bonus or used on a full action space.

Also, everyone was able to set themselves up well with crushing the specific wine tokens they needed for their wine orders. It made for a pretty tight game as the end scoring between three of the players was only a few points off each other. The end game scoring didn’t make that much of a difference in this game, garnering two people only 1 point each, but I can definitely see it making a difference in some games. In the end, I managed to win by being very lucky in drawing a wine order in the winter, being able to crush the exact wine tokens I needed and filling a wine order. It actually helped that I was last to go in the round so no one was able to react to what I was doing. I was able to jump from 14 to 20. Everyone else had set themselves up to fill wine orders next year, but I just squeaked in. I won with 20, my husband had 18, one friend had 17 and our other friend had 9.

In the end, everyone enjoyed the game. Our friend who didn’t do too well is looking forward to playing again to improve their strategy and conquer the mountain that is Viticulture.

What Still Needs Work
The cards still have a huge impact on the game and it’s random. Some people are okay with this. I prefer more control over my euro-style games, even one this light. So we’re going to test out drawing 2 cards and discarding one every time you are to draw a card. I’m worried it will slow the game down, but I think it’d be a good variant to include in the rules for those who prefer more strategy in their games. I don’t think it should be the standard rule, though, but we’ll see how it plays.

We also feel the grey meeple on the 7th space of the wake up track is not enticing enough to go for it over the VP. Our friends did choose it for the first few years, but after that, it got left by the wayside. More experienced players tend to ignore it since they have more efficient strategies. We think it should also have the ability to take a full action space. We’ve played with it having this ability, but not at the same time the Grande Worker has the ability. So we need to test whether it’s too powerful for one person to have two workers that can go on any full space.

I am very happy to see the designers open to changing their game because I feel Viticulture is a good game, but hopefully with these changes, it’ll be well on its way to being a great game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Sarah

Thanks for this. I have not gotten around to testing the new rules yet - for the Grande Worker's new power - did you ever see the first (or early) player use the same action multiple times in a round with it? I had some concern in the closing round they could take the bonus Fill Wine Order slot with a standard worker, and then use the slot again with the Grande.

I suppose other players could "abuse" this earlier in the game but it seems more powerful towards the end.

I know its only 22 votes but why is 3 considered the 'best' for this game when it goes to 6?

Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My guess is that there's a little more wiggle room in odd-numbered games, and 3-player games play faster than 5-player games (20 minutes per player once you know how to play).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, it's probably close between 3 and 5..

3 players adds the center space (which simply adds more variety and makes the game more fun than 2 player imo). You have that also with 4 players but then there is an extra player competing for the same number of action spaces...perhaps that's more fun for some (people that like aggressiveness and conflict more than I do), but the most frustrating thing for me is having the action you need get blocked so in 4 player vs 3 player it's going to happen more.

5 is also really good, but if you're going last (and sometimes it's not preventable) you just have more chances to get blocked even though another chance to go to a spot has been added. The difference is having 2 people possibly blocking 2 spots or 4 people possibly blocking 3 spots. Your odds that the spot you need is still there is simply better in 3 player. Heck, in 5 player if you go last you can have all of your number 1 choice spots blocked AND your back up choice middle action blocked...that can be crippling and unfun depending on the situation.

6 players adds even one more potential blocker to the mix and in some games can be unendingly frustrating...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I tend to like more cutthroat games. Its just a game.

Thanks for the thoughts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cool. Though with more than three players what would you suggest? The full 6?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If I'm playing with people who aren't prone to analysis paralysis, the more the merrier. But I'm biased--I just like it when people want to play my game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you play with 6, I'd make sure everyone knows how to play the game first. If you've got new players, they'll slow things down.

I agree that 3 is the "best" number in terms of a faster game that has the least frustration on blocked spaces. But with the potential new rules, it won't be as big of a deal. We played a 4 player game the other day with the new rules and it was just fine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I like it with any number. There's not a lot of downtime, even with 6, although the game will be longer with more players, I reckon 30 mins per player. I agree it feels less tight with 3, more tight with other numbers of players.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I disagree. There's a lot of downtime in this game. Even if you're people who are on the ball and know what they're doing, there's a lot of "oh he took my action, so now I need to reconsider".

Also, since the turn order changes all the time, people tend to miss that it's their turn. That's really annoying because it either forces me to play policeman ("now it's YOUR turn") or the game drags on forever.

Games that feature variable turn order should include a token that gets passed from player to player. That way, when someone plops it in front of you, there's no forgetting that it's your turn.

In any case, I won't play Viticulture with more than 3 people again (which means I'm never bringing it to game days/evenings anymore because people tend to play at the limit of supported game players).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noel, yes those things do happen, but they haven't been a significant problem for us. I guess it depends on how analysis prone and/or distracted your players get.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Or how impatient I am
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There's always someone who
(1) waits until their turn to decide what to do
(2) you've always got to remind it's their turn
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've found that there can be a lot of downtime in games when players can place multiple workers or take multiple actions in a turn, but in Viticulture, you're only placing one worker per turn. I think that cuts down significantly on downtime. Of course, if you have even one player who doesn't think ahead about their turn at all, it can affect everyone else at the table.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, that's why I don't like Alien Frontiers. Turns can be complex, and you can't really plan them until you roll the dice.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exactly. That's actually the primary reason why you roll dice in Euphoria when you retrieve your workers--you can start figuring out your next turn based on your roll.

My adult daughter joined my wife and I to learn and play two games this weekend and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

Learning and teaching the game seemed like it was going to be more complicated than it turned out to be. Walking through what all the summer and winter actions were was a lot of information to process in the abstract, but once we started play the worker placement choices became pretty clear and the pace of the game moved fairly well. (We did not use the Grande Worker option, which sounds like a good way to move the game along quicker, and also sounds very important for a two player game.)

It took a couple of rereads to get the mechanics of crushing right, but by the end of the two games we had it straight.

The game appears to offer enough multiple paths to pursue that you don't feel shut out very often. The rooster wake-up mechanic gives you the chance to ensure you will get priority enough, and often the visitor cards provide an alternate opportunity for actions you may have been closed out on.

The board and pieces are beautiful, and have already got my wife and daughter thinking on how to enhance the game further with different colored pieces, possibly shaped as grape bunches, to use in place of the beads for crushed grapes and bottled vintages, for example. My only minor complaints are: the cards are small, with small print, and the symbols on the vine cards are a little hard to see, though you get used tot he shapes quick enough; a little heavier card stock would have been nice; and though there are 4 card types, there are only 3 slots in the box for storing the cards.

Overall, a mid-weight worker placement based game with a fun theme you can enjoy while sipping actual "fruit from the vine".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter--Thanks for this summary. I'm glad it didn't take too long to fill out the crushing.

I agree about the symbols on the vine cards. In the second edition we're going to replace them with icons that look like the tokens instead of the art.

We actually made the plastic insert for the cards to be stored vertically, with plenty of room for expansions. Sorry about that for the short term!

Viticulture - Games 2 & 3

I've had a couple of games of Viticulture now where we know the rules correctly. I do find it ever so odd trying to teach people the rules though. I don't know if it's a worker-placement game thing in general, but there just seems to be no easy order to go through things that doesn't feel like you're missing something. Going 'These are the 4 seasons and what they do, then going through cards, and then through the action spaces, and then through the buildings, still had questions unanswered', then again that was more in the 3rd game, in the 2nd everyone was pretty happy with a basic explanation and they all just read what the worker spots do.

Anyway enough about rules and teaching, this is meant to be a session report, albeit a poorly written one! On with the show...report.

I'm going to write that as (- something) being about the game and (= something) being comments on strategy and thoughts on it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Game 2 - 4 Player
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I've still not got the hang of doing session reports, by which I mean not thinking to note down or try and remember what happened exactly, but I'll try to give a rough idea!

An additional point, is there was actually 4 of us in this game. I'm hugely guilty of not mentioning what player 4 (Handy) did, as he's just so quiet :S Also we were consuming alcohol and and and...I'm a bad person. I think he got the lowest score, but he was also the player that hadn't had a previous game (Though the others were only in the game we played wrong anyway), but we all had fun anyway!

- At the start of the game I put myself on the extra worker for the first turn, perhaps over-trusting in the use of it. This left my first turn being a little stuck as I had no way to plant early. Instead I got some tour money (I don't know what they were paying to see!) and replaced that extra worker with a normal worker while my opponents got their early vines planted and crushed. The 2nd round I put myself on the '+1 vine card' and got 1st position, so I got started on planting and harvesting.

= I really like in this game how even when you get locked out of what you might prefer to do (Like plant in the first round) you have plenty of opportunity to chase a different path and feel confident about it.

- The game generally went on with me drawing lots of white vines making a ridiculous white vine field, Kimberley got a massive hand of cards (I don't remember if it helped much) and Ken just seemed to pull every visitor that gives lots of Victory Points, again (He got the same luck in our first game, that we played wrong anyway).

= It's very frustrating in viticulture to not get both types of vine. It's a little bit backed up by starting with that pinot vine though, as while I had no problem harvesting a 9 value grape every turn, I could make a 1 Value red and still make epic blush wine, which helped out a little...

- Just before the end, I think the score was about 10 (Me) - 11 (Kimberley) - 16 (Ken).

= So it looked pretty clear at this point who was winning).

- In the last turn, Ken got first I think and filled another order for 4VP, taking him to 20. I followed up right behind filling a 4Vp order taking me to 14 (I don't remember what Kimberley did, the whole 'Ken getting to 20' was distracting). Think is, I finally got a visitor I wanted in the fall before filling those orders. I got a 'fill an order and get +1 VP' so after leaving the others to think that was it, I jumped on the play a visitor, filled a 6 VP order which took me to 21 with the +1. Ninja'd!

= I love that in building your infrastructure well early rather than relying on VP cards, you have such a chance to catch up and beat people who have seemingly perfect draws. It seems to be the advantage to not having to use your actions to play those cards, that you can instead make awesome wine =P


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Game 3 - 3 Player
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
So I had my 3rd game of viticulture yesterday, this time with 2 people that hadn't played at all.

Strangely enough, my recollection on this game is also terrible, even though it was within the last 24 hours, but I'll do my best. Greg may very well turn up here to tell me everything is wrong and that I've confused all the players, which is fair enough as I'd rather not leave things wrong on the internet! (Also, I remember a lot more of what Greg did probably because I've known him longer!)

- I think turn 1 happened as Greg taking a visitor, myself taking an extra vine, and Jenny taking a wine order card. This gave Greg the chance to get some money and set up an extra worker quite early in the game, while myself and Jenny got vines planted/crushed to get some wine ready for later orders.

= Greg bought up a fairly good point here that the 3rd field feels a little pointless, as you can use field 1 for red and field 2 for white and be done with it. Despite that, I think in my next game I'm going to put the Pinot vine on it's own with red/white in their own fields, because it can be very frustrating when you're short on red wine for blush/sparkling, and a combi-field with low values to combine with your high values from the others seems wise.

- The 2nd turn I decided that it was my turn to build my workforce, so I opted to dive straight for the extra worker, as I presumed Greg would be busy planting/harvesting and that Jenny would struggling to get the money (I think she had 0 Lira at that point). I don't remember what Jenny did, but Greg did indeed get some vines planted, while I took 5 Lira from 2 tours, then 2 workers for 3 Lira each by using the Grande worker for the 2nd.

= I quite like getting 2 workers in one turn, feels good =P

- Again the middle section feels hazy. Over the game Greg managed to build up a small fortune, I went roughly average, and Jenny mostly kept up with me, with the caveat she stuck with 3 workers for a lot of the game. I think Greg was actually behind for quite a while, but managed to dive into the lead with some filled orders/visitor cards.

= While I don't feel that you need 5/6 workers (Even though I tend to aim for 5 with 6 only if I get blocked from other actions), I think an extra 1 to 4 is quite a requirement. One advantage to not taking them is you save actions and money and can still make up that worker by going last some turns for the temp worker.

- I don't remember exactly how it went, but as far as me noticing, Greg took a very sudden leap into the lead onto 16 in Summer on a round, leaving me and Jenny behind. At this point, I had a pretty fun plan, where I could set aside 4 workers for 4 VP and use the last worker (I had 6 by then) to fill another order and hit 20-22 ish (Not sure exactly). The problem there was I didn't have enough grapes/wine to do both the set aside 4 and the fill order. I think I might have managed if I'd opted to go last and take the extra worker, and should have seen that, buuut I didn't =P In the end all 3 of us filled an order in winter (Me via a visitor card again), Greg hit 22, with me and Jenny way behind somewhere around ~15 (I came second just about).

= Lame, I got my ass kicked. Not-lame, I still had fun! It was great to play Viticulture with more people and particularly as Greg has backed Euphoria and read Jamey's blog posts, so he was very excited to get to play Viticulture. Great evening.


EDIT = One additional thing. I think the expanded Grande Worker idea of being able to use a filled space will be perfect for my future 2/4/6 player games. In 3 players, everything works itself out as it is, and that would make it too powerful, but for 2/4/6...perfect.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for another great session report! I just wanted to point out one little thing. You said, "while I had no problem harvesting a 9 value grape every turn," but the maximum value of any field is 6. Just something to keep in mind in the future.

Also, I find that the best way to teach the game is to play a year and explain things as you go (rather than trying to explain everything up front). Players do need to know the connection between vines and wine orders, but they don't need to know the specifics for crushing grapes until year 2 or 3.

Master Vintner: Increase the value of 1 wine token by +2 and fill 1 order.

Do you have to have a cellar that can accommodate the the improved wine?

(I noticed in the FAQ that you aren't able to use the Crush +1 spot to make a blush that doesn't have a spot in the cellar then +1 it into your cellar, so I assume the answer for this card is that you need a cellar to accomodate the +2 wine)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simon--That's correct, you always need the proper cellar to increase the value of any wine token.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the opposite question, using the Crush +1 space, can you make a sparkling wine out of grapes of total value 6 to become a wine of value 7 ?

In a 3 player game there are two spots available at each location to place workers.

Has anyone tried to play a 4 player game using all three spots at each location (including the spot reserved for 5/6 players)?

Just curious....

I have played a 4 player and 6 player game. I did not enjoy the downtime during the 6 player game and in general feel that the game is too tight with an even number of players (something that has been stated a lot on the geek).

We played with the Grande each time and it helps a bit.

I was just wondering if people have tried this simple solution for a 4 player game.... I would think it would allow for the same feel as a 3 player game.

Thoughts?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the downtime with many players, which is problem with MANY games (with few exceptions for example 7 Wonders, Puerto Rico and so on), I suggest you http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9mPFdEkf_E. DGT Cube. A very easy to use and intuitive game timer. Really worth it, kills AP players, but helps everyone else too. This on the other hand takes away from the laid back wine sipping feeling of Viticulture, but if you're GAMING this is the solution!

Now to your other problem. I myself enjoy the even player games, maybe even more than with odd numbers. You need to adapt a lot and I do like that. Making 3 spots available for 4 players opens the game up A LOT and I'm afraid it might be too much. In proportion 3 spaces for 4 players is more than 2 spaces for 3 players.

Naturally, no one's stopping you. Another suggestion I might give you is try giving the temporary worker an ability to work even on full posts. This idea is from Sarah Reed and I really like the idea of it. I haven't tested it but it sounds great, but it is indeed quite powerful. Jamey has been toying with an idea of giving Grande Workers the ability to use the full spots, but that for me would feel like too open game.

Well, y'know, 'cause reading the rules properly is overrated. I blame my housemate...she opted to read the rules =P

I'll start off pointing out the mistakes we made in our first game:
- We took back our workers at the end of Summer.
- We didn't realise you could plant multiple vines in a field, and removed them when harvested.
- We didn't really have any clue about sparkling, and didn't realise that blush was additive when crushing the grapes (So we thought you'd need a 4 red and 4 white to make a 4 blush).

So um...close enough right? Anyway we played with the Grande worker because so many people on these forums say it's practically necessary. It really is when you're playing completely wrong, or you'd never get things you need

We started off each building a trellis and planting a couple of vines (In different fields of course..) over the first couple of rounds, and crushed what we could quickly to get a few grapes, before immediately turning them into wine. That was probably a bit stupid as they sat at the 3 spot in the cellar for ages =P

Every single card I drew for Summer was to build things cheaply, so I had lots of buildings...Not so great as I couldn't use any of them. Every purple card I drew was for high value wines, like 7-9...I never got a single grape/wine to that the whole game so I pretty much had no chance.

One of my friends seemed to get nothing but godlike cards so he had about 10 Lira spare as well as filling in orders in a small number of years. Me and the other player blocked him from building any other vines. His lead was ridiculous though so he just used all his spare money and epic card drawing to get Victory Points other ways. He got to 20 first. I should also add he rushed a few workers, which because of the worker mistake meant he got 3-4 lira every summer/winter putting them in the hire out space!

Despite being behind, in the last year I (finally) picked 2 purple cards I could actually fill and did so, jumping into 2nd place. The last player (Who read the rules!) came in last place, teaching her a lesson in why to read the rules more carefully. Think it was about 20-14-8 in the end.

Needless to say, after our first game I read the FAQ on stonemaier games and looked through the rulebook very carefully. Now that I know our mistakes and what to watch out for next time, I can't wait to get another game in! I can't believe a game about wine-making got my attention so thoroughly, particularly when we didn't even play it correctly giving a friend silly advantages. Hope I can convince(bribe?) people to play again tonight and play correctly.

PS (Avert your eyes wine lovers) I don't even like Wine...why do I like this game =P
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for sharing this, Chris. Hopefully other people will read it and avoid those mistakes. I'm glad you still enjoyed it enough to play it again!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
See what happens when you let someone else read the rules!?! I do like the grande worker although I find he is less necessary in a 3 player game since there are two available slots at each action instead of just one.
Yeah, one person is probably gonna get left out but they probably should have taken that action if they really wanted to
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We played with 4 tonight doing things properly, it's definitely needed for 4 player games! I can see why another proposed change was to be able to take a spot that's already filled with it, as I had a lot of rounds where I couldn't do anything useful. Then again so did everyone =P

Won in the end 21 to 20 (He hit 20 then I ninja filled an order straight after =P). Even more fun when you play it properly!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I agree 2 and 4 player games I use the grande. 3 and 5 I don't because of the available extra spaces! Gratz on the win!

Hello!
The Waco Gaming Convention is scheduled for September 27th-29th. This is in Waco Texas so I hope that my fellow central Texans will be able to come as well as the surrounding area. I am going to bring my two copies of Viticulture and I have set up an official event time on the schedule for Viticulture demonstrations, Friday and Saturday at 3pm. Here is the main webpage and of course it can link you to the warhorn page that lets you register for the Con and of course, my Viticulture demonstration.

What are these used for? Neither are listed in the components. The small heart token says on the back. "Place on visitor action spaces (middle).

I cannot find any instructions that say what to do with the small heart token after placing it.

Our group is very interested in finding out about the heart token.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Heart token is used only with the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
expansion in play.
It changes the middle action space on the Summer and Winter visitor space
to "increase worker morale by 1" (paraphrase of pg 4 of arbor. rulebook).

I believe the burlap sack was intended to store the wine/grape tokens,
but I think a zip-lock bag works better for that, personally.

My game group tried Viticulture today, a game that wasn't really even on my radar as it seemed to blend into the morass of Kickstarter euros offering custom meeples begging for my money. "Winemaking? Ok, I suppose I'll give it a shot..." I've become a big jaded with the good old worker placement mechanic since most new entries seem intent on dumbing things down from my perennial favorite
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in the name of accessibility. Still, my friend paid good money for it so there we were dumping out our baggies of migrant worker and building meeples.


First Impressions


Viticulture initially looks and feels a lot like Lords of Waterdeep. You have your 3 guys and they can do actions on a common board. But the board is divided up into summer and winter halves, and then you have the visitors which are a bit like Waterdeep's Intrigue cards without the direct attack options. There are a few interesting/unique things going on here though:

1. Starting player choice is better than Agricola and Waterdeep. I like how you're not a slave to who is sitting to your left and that there are increasingly tempting bonuses for choosing a worse spot in the turn order.

2. Action blocking and the "tightness" of choices are somewhere between Agricola and Waterdeep. You are not likely to be totally shafted by someone else's move, but being in last place means you may never get to do exactly what you want to. This is tightest at 4 and 6 players because at 5 players each action space opens up to 3 spots instead of 2. My opinion is that 4 players is the sweet spot of this game because of this and the relatively quick play time.


3. I like how the grapes and wine age every year and how selling the wine works. It made that aspect of the game a little more nuanced than a standard pick up and deliver mechanic.

4. The summer/winter trade off of actions made for some tough choices. Do I pass now in summer and save the rest of my workers for winter? But what if everyone does that and then my last two workers have nothing to do?

5. Likewise the mechanic of making the second player to choose a space get a bonus is a great idea. It tempers the benefits of starting player and forces you to guess whether to risk saving a critical action until later in hopes of getting a bonus. (edit: played that rule wrong)


So what's the catch?

Now, like every game Viticulture has its flaws/blemishes/quirks/idiosyncrasies. In general they're not bad, but some players may be irked by them:

1. My major complaint is that the Visitor cards are not balanced. There are distinctly better cards that do the same thing as others but either with a bonus or for a lower cost. Arguably Agricola and Waterdeep also have better and worse situational cards but their value depends on game conditions at the time. Some Viticulture Visitor cards are just plain inferior; and if you draw them while someone else drew an always useful "choose 2 out of three" card or a "gain 4 VP for almost nothing" card then you feel cheated.

2. Visitor cards again-- I love them but there are not enough for a full game. You just go through the decks too many times. If the Waterdeep deck cycled this much then I would have thrown that game away. Viticulture almost gets away with it because sometimes you're happy to get that same great card again but it hurts the replayability. Maybe the expansion fixes this.

3. Thematic integration while generally good for a euro is lacking in two mechanics: Starting player is not thematic. You don't wake up earlier. Also the scarcity of some of the actions is not thematic (much like Agricola) as you should be able to harvest your grapes in reality no matter how many competitors are doing it. But at least you're not living in a village where only one couple is allowed to have sex each season! Ahem.

4. The theme itself and the building aspect of the game is not as satisfying as Agricola. In Agricola I build my little farm up from a dingy hut to a mansion complete with pastures, fields and my very own pet sheep who shares the bed. Sure, Viticulture has you upgrading your cellar and building structure on your vineyard, but at the end of the game you don't feel that sense of personalization and ownership of your little cardboard world. It's much more of a
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VP grab.

5. Viticulture is not quite a gateway game like Waterdeep (but close). I actually consider that a good thing, but in the grand scheme of things it actually took my group who played both Waterdeep and Agricola many times before longer to learn Viticulture than either of those games. The rulebook is okay, but there are a lot of little rules to learn and piles of cards to figure out. By the second year (summer/winter cycle) we figured out the action valuation and got going, but I don't recommend this as your first worker placement game as it builds upon the mechanics of a few other games.

6. Viticulture is also not a brain burningly complicated game like some Feld games and Splotter games. The decisions are nuanced but forgiving. It is possible to catch up with a good run of Visitor cards or wine orders. I can see it getting dull without an expansion within a dozen or so games.


So is it worth it?

In short: yes. Perhaps I'm saying that because I know there already is an expansion, but Viticulture is a fun game. It won't quite dethrone Agricola for me (yet), but it is the closest game so far. Waterdeep may get fired by Viticulture in my game group because of the increased complexity without adding fiddliness. I may have gone into the game jaded and suspicious, but color me pleasantly surprised with this winemaking romp.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for your review. My family and friends have been enjoying the game for the past couple weeks.

We might be playing wrong, but there are two things in your review that confused me:
1. We've been playing that the first person to go an area CAN take the bonus spot as long as he is capable of using the bonus (whereas you wrote that the first person can't take the bonus spot.
2. I can't remember a bonus card that gives you 4 points for nothing. Are you thinking of the Entertainer card? But that one requires you to put aside something like 4 workers for the whole year.

Again, I have only two games experience, so I might be off base.

However, instead of/in addition to converting lira to victory points, why not also use it to auction off the choice to go first? To keep it quick, have people put the lira in their hand they want to bid (could be 0, of course), and everyone reveals their bid at the same time. Early game, I wouldn't pay anything, but if I had extra lira late in the game and really wanted to be first, I could spend it then. Cocks get placed in auction order; ties would still go in normal grape order.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's an intriguing idea, Eric. It's worth exploring, particularly if the end-game scoring doesn't work.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I like that idea a lot. Towards the end of the game and especially if it's the last turn, being the player to place your rooster first is a huge advantage. Seating order can really screw you at that point.

This would be a great way to get around that issue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's a step that might add a bit of hassle, but probably not too much. I love hidden bidding. And thematically it's not impossible to get in the mix. Round of city official bribing, the one who bids the most gets a free pass from him to decide what they want to do for the rest of the year. Get some vines from the storage or ask some visitors to join them later on...

Well, if this part is called bribing it would most likely not click with everyone if the theme is peaceful wineyard in Tuscany. But would work for me!

Would everyone lose the amount they bid even though they didn't win? Would fit the bribing thing and depending on the metagame it would either be a big money sink "I just NEED to get this one and bid HIGH" and everyone would go high. Or people might bid one or two lira if they didn't absolutely need the first position.

And would the rooster placing go in bidding order or clockwise from the winner? If you lost everything you bid even if you didn't win, it should maybe go in bidding order because it would give you incentive to bid even if you weren't sure you wouldn't win the bid. On the other hand, bidding order would add too much hassle and remembering on who gets to place first rooster. But this could be solved with the wakeup track... If you were the second highest bidder, you'd put your rooster on the number two and so on. Hmm.

The bidding reminds me of Game of Thrones boardgame which it fits VERY well. (with you lose everything you bid) On the other hand it reminds me of Pillars of Earth "pay a lot if you want to go first".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I hate bidding, leave it as it is.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm glad I'm not the only one who calls them cocks. Rooster is just such a funny-sounding word to me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While I like the idea of using the Lira for something like that, it would be very frustrating if it was for who goes first. The way it's set up at the moment means everyone gets a chance to go first, whereas if you auction it off, one person could just get screwed by another player having money for no real reason.

Having said that, if you think of other things to pay the lira for in auction, then it could be interesting.

Viticuluture is one of my A list games. And yes I kickstarted it.

I’ll spare you how awesome all the components and artwork are and leave that to one of the many more well produced videos you can watch about this game. Go watch Mr. Vasel, Rahdo, or a Drive Thru Review to see the components. But still the components and artwork are awesome. /cast (Component sqweee rank 4)

When I first opened Viticulture the wood pieces wafted and smelled like a smoked cheese. At first, I’m like what carcinogen from a Chinese factory am I taking into my system? But then realized hey this just adds to the charm and pairs well with a wine game. Just like a stinky leather cup pairs well with Stone Age. Unintentionally well played Stonemaier Games.

The number of players is less determining of the modifications to gameplay and rather determined by an even or odd number of players. Even player games seem to be tighter based upon the allocation of available spaces you can place your workes. I will never ever (again) play a 6 player game of Viticulture, which is sad, as I really saw this as a capability for accommodating 3 sets of couples to play this game.

Viticulture is more about the journey or experience of owning a winery, not actually making wine. Making wine may be one of the things you do at your winery, but is not actually required. I have actually won a game without producing any wines, but it is difficult to do and harder to pull off in a 2 player game, than a 3 player game, or if you use the ‘grande worker’ variant.

Money becomes a non issue at the end of the game. It would have been neat to see a purchasable prestige that changes per round like in Macao, but there are times you can end up having a whole pile of money (even with good planning) and it means absolutely nothing, but that is part of the game and I accept that fact, I just make sure I tell new players that before they jump into their first game.

Most of your games will run from 8 to 10 rounds. The person with the tightest point building engine will have the advantage, which will then have deviations of who can get the best cards (be it orders or visitors) that will fit into that engine that is your winery.

On a side note I had one panel of my Arboriculture expansion double print one half of the original cellars rather than the “field” panels that make up the Aboriculture expansion. Jaime had a full set of replacements shipped to me next day. That was totally out of the blue and also speaks volumes to the company and their commitment to their games and their alacrity for customer service. It is one of those things that gets overlooked often and I wanted to being light to it.

I have one big issue with the theme of Viticulture, and it is as follows:
I love the wake up track mechanic; it is one of my favorite overall game mechanics. But, the numbers on the side of the wake up selection aren’t even timeslots. And how does waking up 1 hour later cause me to have a visitor show up as opposed to a victory point showing up at my vineyard? Is “6” a prestigious wakeup time in Italy? Or who the heck gets up at 1, can anyone even see the vineyard at that time. And are you saying my worked get up at the same time every day all year through each of the seasons? I get the jist of it, but it is not like Fresco’s “per day” wake up track to an actual wake up time. Viticulture tries to pulls off, but it doesn’t make sense over a year.

I have compiled a small comparison to Vinhos as well as what should be a beginner player guide for Viticulture below.


===================================================

Viticulture vs. Vinhos :

Forgiveability:
Viticulture is not punishing for not having an efficient well though out engine. You will not starve, lose points, or be thrown in jail for not predicting an earthquake or hiring vine seismologists. In Viticulture you just won’t do as well, but you won’t lose anything. You will just get left behind all the other players. Vinhos you can have bad crops, create negative wine, have wine go bad, go in debt, and lose workers (enologists) for not paying them. I call this the anti Agricola effect.

End points or standing empire:
Viticulture is what have you done for me lately? …and by lately I mean now. Making wine is not your end goal, getting to 20 VP’s is your goal everything after that and leading up to that are irrelevant. Vinhos is all about planning for the extra points you will get at the end of the game, such as bank balance, various end game scoring tracks, and choosing to make points now versus later. Viticulture is make your points now, yes plan for future points, but the mechanism by which you make your points during the game doesn’t mean jack later on. Where as in Vinhos, end game points will make or break you. As stated above in Viticulture it is very possible to win a game without ever producing wine.

Simplicity:
Viticulture is simple in that anyone can get the idea of how to play. They may not be good, but they are capable. With Vinhos, there is a freaking tutorial on just teaching you on how to teach people to play.

Stealing this from one of my prior posts:
Viticulture = Welcoming like warm apple pie. It is solid enough for gamers while catering to casuals. We wife's book club coupld easily play this game.

Vinhos = Once you get some training in how to play it, and train some others that won't facemelt when you open the box, it is immensely satisfying. The type of satisfying like throwing a mars lander through space and landing something the size of a mini cooper on the 4th planet, only with wine references. New gamers will run from Vinhos like it is the freaking zombie apocalypse. And I'm fine with that.

Vinhos is metagames of metagames built upon the main game. It is complicated and I love it. Getting my wife to play it is like trying to coax someone with motion sickness to try and ride roller coasters. They may get some enjoyment and accomplishment out of it, but it is going to end badly, no matter how much fun I had.

==================================
For New Players:

It is of my opinion, these should be the items required to tell new players of Viticulture:

1) The game is about building a winery, not actually making wine will get you the win, but it will help.
2) Money is good for getting your engine built, but is not as useful at the end of the game, but it is a decider in tiebreakers.
3) Your pinot vine you start out with, you can’t plant it until you build something (trellis) that allows you to plant it.
4) Hold onto cards that can score points in end game siturations. There may be someone that taps out at 20 points early leaving you high and dry.
5) Those stickers mean nothing; there will be no GMO vines modifying base points in this game. Also don’t you dare think of doing such, this isn’t Risk Legacy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now you are going to make me have to update all my new game scores.

I have gone and updated the score in my games list. I did not put what I gave it in my post as it will change in the future.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for this great write-up! I agree that the wake-up track doesn't really match the theme throughout the year, but mechanically I think it's pretty sound. I appreciate you taking the time to write all this!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You could change it to times (5am, 6am, 7am, etc) ala Fresco.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I thought about it, but I didn't want to rip off Fresco more than I already had! I've actually reached out to the designer of Fresco to offer him a copy of Viticulture, but I never heard back from him.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1003881:
Awesome game with awesome components. Let me just start out by saying I was thrilled when I saw the components. Huge USC fan and Alum, so the wake-up figures are awesome. Go Cocks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: We had some minor rules mix-ups, but the game still stood on it’s own two feet.
1. 6 Max grapes in a Field (Noticed this in another post)
2. When you crush Wine you can make as many as one type. I know it’s written, but I like my rules chunky, not broken down into italicized notes. That’s example text people. Speaking of which, where are the examples? Saving ink?

So the game started up and we spent some time deciphering pieces etc. One thing we didn’t need help with was the Cocks. People immediately kept fiddling with them and of course making sound effects. Lots of fun.
So we all were familiar to some degree with Fresco so we thought the idea of the wake up track and placing our Cocks was really interesting. With only three of us in the game the Cock competition was tight, but more really playful. A lot of people do want to go first especially late game. So there is a lot of “Cock Fighting” later in the game. Early on not so much, although it was pretty exhilarating when Bryan would put his cock right above mine. Only to have Bob slide his right in between and force me into third position. So as far as using the Cocks to build tension, Mission accomplished.

Rest of the game went pretty well. I think the interesting part is when to save workers. Certain spots are definitely more valuable. I rarely saw Vineyard tour not get taken in a 3-player game. Bryan rushed to get extra workers, which seems like the path to victory. Like Tzolkin, I’m not sure the exact number of workers. This play Bryan steadily beat us, but on the next play in a 4 player game it was down to the wire.
In the 4 player game, 3 people had a chance to win on the last turn, but Kiri had the Grapes and put his Cock right in the first slot. He actually won the game this way. Maybe it would have been different, if Crushing wasn’t such a bottleneck. Will do another session when it’s played right, but everyone really liked this one. If you can find it I’d say go for it. Really fun, and what I thought was a gimmick (wakeup track) became a fun part of the game. Even though first to choose is usually going to put their Cock in the first spot, and then it’s just a Cock lineup.

Awesome job Stonemaier. You’ve got some fans in Western MA

I'm glad you liked the game Christofer. Just to clarify, I believe it's vines of total value 6 in a field.

I have some swag to give away to players, compliments of Stonemaier Games.

Hilo ID 1003061:
I've previously played Viticulture with 3 and 4 players and noted the difference between 3-player (plenty of room for most actions) and 4-player (not nearly enough room for most actions). So it was kind of a new experience playing against my wife, who is not a gamer, but who agreed to play because
(a) This is my least nerdily-themed game.
(b) I let her pick the merlot-colored pieces.
(c) She was excited to see how well Jamey put this together.

Our first game ran at a fairly even, but slow pace. We both began with selecting the bonus locations on Spring - she with vines, I with the extra worker - to try to get a vineyard planted early. We were both held back until the fifth turn from filling and order because of a mismatch with the order cards to our vines. I made the mistake of harvesting often, crushing often, which delayed her from having wines in the cellar but also allowed her workers to build those extra cellars so that when the right order came in, she was ready to match quickly. Final score: 24 - 22.

Both of us learned a few important lessons - and for me, distinctions from the 3- and 4-player games that we took into the second game:
(1) With the scarcity of the vital planting, building, crush and fill actions, it is vital to go first whenever initiative is yours. We joked that "you have initiative so you're going to let me decide which way I want to miss actions."
(2) More than 4 workers seems like a waste - in fact, it seems a better option to train only 1 extra worker and use the 7th Spot (Gray worker - or Gastarbeiten as I call him) whenever initiative isn't in your favor.
(3) The summer and winter visitors can guide strategy more than be random pushes in a close game.

So going into the second game it felt more like a race, vying for that right spot to plant, build and produce. I started off luckily with a summer visitor who let me convert one structure into another, and chose to build a trellis then convert it to a tasting room. That was actually a dumb idea - it behaved as a sunk cost to pull one worker into Tours when I had initiative, and was useless when my wife did. She built the Tasting Room later on, after she had 5 workers and could afford to spend her first one on the tours. I would have better-spent that visitor by building irrigation because it wasn't until the 4th turn that I had any vines planted ... and my wife already had grapes aging.

My wife crushed smartly and used the Crush Expert and Jack of All Trades to her advantage, turning her very full crush pads into full cellars and filling orders three turns in a row while blocking me from using the crush pads. My yoke helped to keep my pads full ... as did her block. By the 7th turn she was up 14-10, by the 8th it was 17-12 and by the 9th her victory was secured with a 4-VP fill.

I learned here that 2-player means you have to be very focused. In my initial review (posted enthusiastically a few months back) I talked about the need for a plan B. This is true in 3- and 5-player but I think in 2-player and possibly 4- and 6-, where you may be blocked from making your moves, having a plan B is a stopgap. More importantly you should have a plan for turns when you have initiative and turns when you don't, and I think it's possibly a viable strategy to focus on producing one type of wine, and that's if you cannot work backwards from a fillable order card to planting, harvesting and crushing in short order.

One of the biggest tangles that kept me from doing much for the first half of the game was a sheer mismatch of vines to orders - my first two order cards were for sparkling wines but my first two vines were Sauvignon Blanc and Cabernet Sauvignon. Pursuing those cards would have required four years for four constructions - trellis, irrigation, medium cellar and large cellar - and that's without any helpful summer visitors (which I didn't use correctly) or my incorrect usage of Handyman to chuck trellis in the vain hope of being able to constantly conduct tours. Had I the option, I would have traded all four cards in and started over with one new vine and one new order.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's a fascinating idea for a variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1002962:
I'm probably over thinking this card, but I just wanted to get clarification on it. Does the Mentor card mean that each player decides which 1 type they are crushing or does it mean that the person playing the card decides which 1 type is crushed for all?
Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each decides for themselves.

Each person gets to decide individually.

Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cool. I had this question too.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Different question about same card -- what is the order in which players determine their choice? Does it start with the player playing the card and go around clockwise? Or does it start with the person to his/her left so that the playing player makes final decision?

--David (this can be interpreted as a more general question about Visitor cards where "all players" can do things -- what is the order in which those players decide?)

The decisions are made in wake-up order.

Hilo ID 1001961:
There have been several games in recent years that tackle the theme of wine making. And why not? It’s easy to comprehend and has a romantic quality that isn’t present while building medieval postal routes. Viticulture is among the most recent to allow players to start up their wineries. And here, each player takes on the role of a wine producer in Tuscany. Players are forced to balance actions between income, planting, harvesting, and actually making the wine and filling orders.

The Basics. The game is played over a series of years until one person hits 20 points. Each year is divided into four seasons starting with the spring. Players go through each in sequence. In the spring, all they have to do is decide their player order. Going first allows you the best pick of actions, but no bonus. If you choose to take the second spot instead, you’ll go second (if someone takes the first spot), but you’ll get to draw a free vine card. And so the bonuses get better and better until the sixth and seventh spots allow free points or an extra worker for the year.

Then comes summer. The main action board is divided into winter and summer actions. In the summer, players can give tours for cash, build new structures on their personal board, sell grapes, accept the help of visitors, and plant grapes. Getting additional buildings is critical to Viticulture. Your personal winery starts with nothing more than a crush pad and a small cellar. But, players can upgrade the cellar into medium or large versions. Plus they can build trellises or irrigation to allow for better grapes to be planted. So too, can they build a yoke which allows extra actions, or a windmill or tasting room that will provide victory points when taking certain actions. When choosing what buildings to create, players are essentially adopting and enhancing the strategies they intend to pursue. Players can pass at any time and save remaining workers for the winter. Players do not take workers back between seasons.

In the fall, each player may draw one visitor card. There are summer visitors who tend to help with summery things (like building or planting) and winter visitors who tend to help with wintery things (like crushing and harvesting).

Finally, players take winter actions. The winter board allows player to harvest grapes, crush them into wine, hire new workers, draw order cards, fill orders, and work with winter visitors. Filling wine orders is the major way that players score points, and the winter season has the majority of related actions. This often makes winter hotly contested for space.

The game also scales based on the number of players. Each action has up to three spots and each spot can accommodate one worker. In a two player game, only one spot is used. So each time an action is taken, it is denied to the other player. In a three or four player game, two spots are used. And in a five and six player game, all three spots see action. And, the second spot, which may be taken first in a 3+ player game, also contains a bonus of some kind. So the first player to take the action generally gets a small bonus.

The Feel. Viticulture is an amazingly succinct yet challenging worker placement game. Although the major mechanic is worker placement, the game flows very smoothly and has tons of interesting decisions. And, interestingly, it forces players into different paths almost from the very beginning. Each player starts with a Pinot vine in their hand. But Pinot requires a Trellis before it can be planted. Since there are only so many building spaces, only so many players will have Trellises to plant their Pinot in the first turn. So the other players will have to give tours for money or use their summer visitors to keep moving forward.

And, the interesting thing is, those alternate actions are not necessarily less optimal than simply building the Pinot. Money is hard to come by in the early game, so giving a tour is a huge attraction. In fact, the player that gives a tour is often a player that can get a new worker. So, even if he didn’t have the chance to plant his Pinot, he might be the first to have a fourth worker and be able to exploit that advantage on further turns.

All players are competing for points and the chief source of points are the wine order cards. So every player will want to get wine orders, make wine, and fulfill the demand. This might have resulted in a simple race with the first players to pull ahead having a major advantage. But instead those bonuses provide fantastic catch-up mechanisms. Constructing buildings for less allows players to be more efficient. A player with extra grapes who couldn’t crush the turn before might sell and gain a point that way. Being able to harvest two fields instead of one might allow for more grapes and potentially more wine with an efficient crush.

The other notable aspect of the game are the summer and winter visitors. Each provides a one time special action. Some allow the player to perform more efficient versions of other actions. A player might be able to give a tour, crush grapes, or fulfill an order even if the action spots for those actions have all been filled, so they provide an alternate avenue. Others provide one time bonuses that can be used to great effect. For example, the handyman allows you to convert any structure to any other structure, so a player can eliminate the yoke which cost him 2 (or only 1 if he got the bonus space when taking the action) and replace it with the Tasting Room or Large Cellar which would normally cost 6. Gaining these cards and using them effectively can be key to victory.

Player scaling is pretty wonderful. The game plays up to six which my group really appreciates. Once you have six players, the options for games falls off precipitously, but Viticulture easily supports six players. Although the game says it takes 45-90 minutes, I think this is really an underestimate. Only my two player game has fallen within that timeframe. Both the four and the six player took closer to two hours. The nice thing, though, is that increasing the number of players doesn’t substantially increase play time.

The one negative is that the two player game is simply less interesting and less dynamic than the 3-6 endeavor. The reason is that the two player game lacks the bonus spaces. This means that it is hard to catch up by selling grapes or building structures more efficiently than an opponent who is ahead of you. The alternate actions are simply not as good in some instances, and the result is a feeling that once one player has gotten ahead, that lead is quite easily maintained. Although the game is still enjoyable, I know I’ll be reserving Viticulture for plays with three or more.

Components: 4.5 of 5. On first glance, the pieces in this game are fantastic. Every single player piece is unique. There are separate wooden bits for each building type: trellis, irrigation, yoke, Tasting Room, Windmill, cottage, small cellar, and large cellar. The variety is fantastic – especially for something that would have easily been accomplished with little cubes or cardboard tokens. Player score markers, residual payment markers, and wake-up markers are also unique. In order to keep track of wine and grapes, the players utilize clear glass beads – an ingenious and simple design that works effectively. The only complaint here, and it is a rather minor one, is that the cards are small and thin. I generally dislike small size cards and the thickness could be better. I’m not too worried about the cards being damaged, but I do feel the need to shuffle gingerly.

Strategy/Luck Balance: 4 of 5. Viticulture straddles the divide between strategy and luck very effectively. The core of the game, the worker placement, is wholly strategic and devoid of luck. But, layered on top of that are the four cards – vines, wine orders, summer visitors, and winter visitors. The visitors provide various powers, though of roughly equal value, but there is luck in drawing them. Generally they are helpful, but occasionally you draw one that doesn’t align with your needs. More luck-based is the draws for vines and wine orders. Sometimes you draw heavy red grapes and light white ones, but then orders that require multiple white wines. The key, though, is to draw early and go from there. Perhaps the ability to draw two or three cards and select one would have been nice, but it isn’t strictly needed.

Mechanics: 4.5 of 5. I love the way that Viticulture flows. The springtime action of deciding turn order is fantastic and allows for strategic choices from the get-go. The constant need to adapt as various actions become unavailable is a hallmark of the genre, but implemented to wonderful effect here. And, the visitor cards provide just the right release valve so that the game doesn’t stagnate with preferred strategies that ossify and make the game dull. Plus, I think the bonuses are an inspired method of keeping the game interesting and allowing efficiencies in line with the player’s strategy, or in making second choice actions more beneficial. The one negative here is that the game loses out with only two players.

Replayability: 4 of 5. No random setups, no random player powers. Yet the game has tremendous replay value. It allows for a wonderful variety of strategies and the cards provide sufficient randomization to encourage players to pursue different paths each game. Plus, actions will often change value based on what others have. If my opponent has a full cellar, I know he may be going to fill an order. So it becomes important for me to go first so I can fulfill my order first. Or, if he has built the tasting room, I might take the tour action just to prevent him from doing it and gaining a point.

Spite: 1.5 of 5. Spite definitely exists. There are no attacking, “take that” cards in the game, but actions can be taken simply to steal them away from another player. Even so, there is very little feeling of spite. With each step having multiple spots, it takes two or three players to fully prevent another from taking an action. As such, the feeling of spite gets diffused among many players and that helps. Of course, if a full fledged syndicate occurred, that might engender bad feeling. But on its own, Viticulture does little to engender spite.

Overall: 4 of 5. Viticulture provides an excellent worker player experience for three to six players. At two, I’d pass in favor of something else. But with three or more, Viticulture is filled with difficult choices, multiple strategies, and just the right amount of luck and randomization to keep the game interesting. The final turns are often tense and, for me, fraught with regret. In one game I thought, “Curses! Why didn’t I get an extra worker?” In another, “Curses! Why did I waste an action getting another worker?” That kind of variety in play is fantastic, and Viticulture is a wonderful game filled with fun.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Small correction, unless I'm reading it wrong. It's actually the second player to take the action that gets the bonus.

Small quibble, also. "Cellar," not "seller."

Other than that, great review! Keep it up!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1001880:
Playing last Friday, the owner of the game, who had played at DieCon with the designer (but not in the same session as I did), said the designer had made a clarification on the Crush space that seems contrary to the way the rules normally work, at least to me.

Let's say you have a white grape worth 3 on your crush pad, and you choose the crush action. Both the +1 spot and a different crush spot are open. You do not have a medium cellar. Can you use the +1 spot anyhow?

More generally, can you use the +1 crush spot on the crush action space if you do not improve the value of any of the winces you crush, when another crush space is available?

MY initial reaction was that the +1 spot could not be used, but the game-owner assured me this had arisen in his session, and that the designer had ruled the +1 space could be used.

Edit: This question does not apply to the second edition, where 1) the crushing rules have changed, and 2) you are allowed to take a bonus space even if you can not take advantage of the bonus. So I am striking it out.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UPDATE 9/25/2014:

This thread may be a little confusing for people who are looking for clarifications on the second-edition rules, so I just wanted to take a second to clarify how crushing grapes now works for ALL copies of Viticulture.

The “crush grapes” action will henceforth be knows as “make wine.” Specifically: Make up to 2 wine tokens. If you choose the bonus action space ("+1"), you may make an additional wine token.

There are no restrictions to the TYPE of wine you can make. You are only limited by your grapes and your cellar. Thus if you want to make one red wine and one champagne, if you have the 1 white grape, 3 red grapes, a medium cellar, and a large cellar, you can make those 2 wine tokens (remove the grape tokens from your crush pad and place the wine tokens in your cellar).

These rules are explained in detail in the second edition rule book: https://app.box.com/s/ehv2l00bzij5rdn7qrax

These kind of came up in the game I just played earlier today:

For cards such as Guest Speakers and Mentor, can I play them without do the action myself (train a worker for 1 Lira and crush respectively)? Somewhat related, can I play Assessor if that is the only card in my hand (and thus get 0 Lira)? Mainly asking because they can be used to block the 2-blue card spot if allowed, so I was wondering.

For Queen, if some players have less than 2 Lira, can this be played?

For cards that say "up to", can that mean 0? Such as Harvester, Broker, Uncertified Broker. Again, this can be used to block the 2-yellow card spot.

Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good questions!

I think for Queen, the money comes from the bank, not the other players.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh... For Queen, that actually makes sense.

One other question... should I have 2 Guest Speakers in my box? haha.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, you must be able to complete the action and conditions.
It is specifically forbidden in the FAQ to 'block' a spot w/o completing the action yourself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.stonemaiergames.com/faq-viticulture/

I asked the same question myself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I agree, Thomas, but these particular cards seem different, since they say "You may..." and "Up to...".

Maybe they're just not worded very clearly...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thomas, I would agree that the intent was probably that the person who played the card should do the action.

The problem is that "may" implies you don't have to (commonly used this way in other games). I've also seen "up to" mean that 0 is allowed in other games as well. So either it is bad wording or that is the intent.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for your questions. I'll clarify the answers below:

I'm actually surprised that other games allow you to choose 0 when using the word "up to." It doesn't make sense. There is a card in Viticulture that says "Plant up to 2 vines." If you could choose 0, there is no planting happening. So in order for you to plant, you need to actually plant something. 1 is thus the clear minimum, both mechanically and thematically.

As for the use of "may," there is a choice. You may do it or you may not. That word is used on cards like the mentor, which says, "All players may crush grapes into one type of wine. Draw 1 of any card for each other player who does this."

Thus each player (including you) has the choice to crush or not crush when you play that card.

As for the Queen, yes, the money comes from the bank, just like on any other card that lets you gain money.

Good questions!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So I might have been mistaken about the "up to" in other games. I thought Survive! had that, but when I looked at the manual just now, it doesn't (it actually specifies you "may" move the creature when you roll the die, thus accounting for the 0-movement option).

On Guest Speakers and Mentor, can I play them even though I (or any other players) can't do the action? For example, if I've already trained all my workers or I have no money for Guest Speakers.

And Assessors, can I play it even if it is my last card (and thus I get 0 Lira)? It's a dumb/waste of a move to do that, but just curious, since, it can be used to block.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can play guest speakers and the mentor even if you can't do it. Technically if you looked around the table and saw that no one (including you) could use the abilities on those cards, you would not be able to play them. But I think it's a very rare circumstance that you'd want to do that.

For Assessors, it's similar to planting. You can't gain 0, so you can't play it if you have an empty hand.

The game discourages blocking for the sake of blocking--there's already enough blocking that happens organically in the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So what if you can't crush grapes, and everyone else decides not to, to deny you taking the visitor spot?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's fair play, Simon. As long as someone is able to make that choice, the card is playable (since you can't control what other players choose).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 1001279:
So my husband and I finally got Viticulture back to the table. This time we decided to go back to the base game; however, we wanted to incorporate some of the variants that people have been talking about. So we played with the Grande Worker that allows you to get the bonus space (which is very helpful in a 2 player game). We also made the grey worker on the 7th spot in the wake up chart a little stronger and gave him the ability to go to any space that is already full. Lastly, we did an exchange of money for VP at the end with 10 lira for 1 VP.

This was a longer game that we’ve played before, not so much in time it took, but the number of years in game terms. It lasted 9 years and was a very tight race the whole game. We both had trouble in the mid-game with about 3 years where no one made any progress on the VP track. In the end, my husband was able to get ahead and max out at 25 while I was only able to get to 22 VP.

I took a risky move early on by using the Uncertified Broker to go negative VP to gain money. In the next year, I took the grey worker and built both the Cottage and Tasting Room. While I was able to bounce back by using the Broker later, I spent the last several years of the game drawing visitor cards that I couldn’t use. On the second to last round, we both got 19 points at the same time, but he had wine and grapes while I had nothing. It just goes to show that card advantage is important, but if you don’t draw useful cards, you can’t get anywhere.

As for my husband, he tried to take advantage of any visitor cards that provided easy VP while at the same time, build up a collection of wine orders in his hand early on so he could have a focus for late game. This allowed him to keep himself goal-oriented and helped him avoid reacting to my choices that made him uneasy. For example, I built the Wine Tasting Room and he never went out of his way to block the tour space. This reacting to my choices has led to losses in the past so he knew he needed to try a new strategy. Fortunately, by the end of the game, he created a setup where he simply had more gas in his tank to create more VP than I did, which gave him the possibility to outpace her. In fact, he would have gotten to 29 points if there hadn’t been a cap on the VPs.

This was our fourth time playing the game, third time with just us. We definitely prefer having the variants that we played with this time. This allowed for the Grande Worker and the extra grey worker to have vastly different abilities while at the same time promoting an extremely fluid game-play. The grey worker was chosen almost every year – that’s how much of an impact his ability had on the game. It allowed each player to avoid any stalls in their strategy and is probably what resulted in such a tight game. On the other hand, the Grande Worker felt like a very impactful choice which provided a very dynamic option each year.

The 10 lira for 1 VP didn’t have a big impact on this particular game as I only managed to buy 1 VP and my husband not only didn’t have the money, but he was already maxed out. While this may indicate that it could be lowered, this might create too much imbalance in the end game scoring. We’d need to play with it a few more times to see if 10 is the best number.

Now, when it comes to what we don’t like, it all comes down to the very last year. Every single game we’ve played, there comes a point where continuing to play out the rest of the year is meaningless. Either the options you need are already taken or you just don’t have the means to create more VPs. This results in a very abrupt stop that feels unsettling. The issue comes from the fact that you feel that you didn’t actually finish a game, but rather just stopped partway through it and declared a winner. Of course if you come into the game prepared for this sudden stop, it’s something you can easily overcome. But this does represent one major element that could turn people off the game.

Another thing that may turn people off is the card drawing that appears in the game. This, by no means, is a bad mechanic. Rather it bothers some players since this is a euro-style game and having a heavy random component usually goes against the design of most euro games and therefore partially disrupts a typically euro-gamer’s approach. It should be mentioned that ignoring the card drawing options will hurt you as a player as will over-drawing cards will present you with issues not having cards that are entirely helpful to you. The trick is not all the cards are bad, but moderating their drawing and usage is a major strategy in the game.

The above is something my husband understands much better than I, so I am the one who complains about getting “bad” cards when it’s more that I’m not adapting to what I’m drawing. In this game, I took risks early on that got me ahead, but I didn’t keep doing that. I held myself back to take the safe route after a point. My husband, on the other hand, kept pushing forward and didn’t let the cards dictate what he did.

In the end, to help those who may be struggling with this game or playing it for the first time, don’t try to rely on any one particular thing to make your entire strategy work. This is a game about adaptability as much as it about strategy. If you go three or four years not adapting your strategy, then you’ll find yourself on the losing end. It’s really a hybrid of a euro-game feel with Ameri-trash pacing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I definitely like the variations suggested...they sound like an interesting wrinkle...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This.
I agree one hundred percent...It's interesting how you're going along going along and suddenly BAM you're at end game...or how you're not rewarded for making a good vineyard so much as you are for crossing the finish line anyway you can. Establishing a good chain of grapes an wines won't do you any good if you can't get any orders out the door before someone else finishes end game on you. My first game (2 player) ended 18 to 21 (me losing) but if I'd had a 3 more years I am pretty sure I could have easily scored 40 points where as my opponent was consistently scoring a couple VPs each year but rarely more than that he would have been lucky to hit 30 in 3 more years. It was a good lesson to learn.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can you expand on this? What does over drawing mean in this context and how is it even possible...it seems like later in this write up you suggest that you stick to a strategy rather than adjusting to cards you draw to your detriment but if you're continually drawing aren't you more likely to find those cards you need to make your strat work?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What sort of adapting do you think you didn't do that you could have...or do you have any hard examples?

I've only gotten to play this twice, once with 2 players and once with 5. Both games were frustrating (though 5-player less so) for basically the same reason: when your first choice of action was taken your subsequent choices were not nearly as good...For example if I want to play 2 yellow cards having that taken before my turn comes up just leaves me with very less desirable choices, and sure the grande worker would help with that but I think about other worker placement games and I think the ones I like best are the ones where I have several things I really want to do and I can do them in basically any order so you don't feel so perpetually "blocked"...Getting blocked in a worker placement game is fine unless it KEEPS happening, ya know?

The other thing I found myself not caring for is how winter actions are so slave to order of operations. Filling orders and Crushing grapes are completely wasted choices if you haven't harvested...that's not bad per se, especially since early game it allows you to spend more workers in summer but it can certainly be frustrating.

I really imagine the sweet spot for this game will be 3 players (when considering available spaces vs players) unfortunately it's very rare that I get to play in groups of that size...maybe some day.

http://www.stonemaiergames.com/2000-viticulture-expansion-de...

Oh my... Well, first thing that really makes me VERY excited is the expansion pack. THREE EXPANSIONS? What!? SICK! Just when I got over the long wait period with Viticulture. (Very long for me and a LOT longer for my wife who had to listen to my Viticulture hype for the first month after backing and the last month before it arrived.) Really excited again... Really really excited!

But is that all? Oh no, it isn't! Behold, the fourth expansions! Designed by...oh...maybe YOU? And like that honor to get your expansion published by Stonemaier Games wouldn't be enough you will get $2000 on top of that. Just thought I mentioned that too, not a big deal really.


.......AAAAAAAA. So...uh...no one else's interested except me? I wish.

Are you going to participate? How does this make you feel? How great is this?

I really wonder which direction my thought process will go...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is very exciting! Both in terms of the future of Viticulture and for indie designers. We're definitely going to give it a try! Only got 3 months though!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh right, indeed, didn't even check the deadline. 3 month will be tough for me as I haven't gotten enough plays yet to have a clear understanding on what is needed. On the other hand I have no designing experience.

These two factors together might make me give up trying seriously. But I'll surely give it a shot just for fun! Won't submit it if it doesn't feel good as I bet Jamey and Alan will have quite much testing to do.

...and was too worked up last night and didn't even read the submission rules. They sure are tough! But that is understandable as the amount of random entries could get big if they weren't that strict.

For many people the prototype and good amount of playtesting will most likely be the key factors for not participating.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've been persuaded to throw my hat in the Viticulture ring by some friends. I've got a solid idea, but merging it with the existing game will take some more thought and time.

My biggest concern is I have zero artistic talent and sending the big cheese behind the game pieces of cardboard with sharpie writing on it will bounce me from serious consideration.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't think it will necessarily disqualify you. After all, the rules state that you should have placeholder art. You just need to make the prototype as clear and functional as possible so they can test it. They'll redo everything for printing anyways.

For various reasons, we've decided to not pursue entering, but that's okay because we have our own games we're working on and I was really concerned about how behind we would get on those to pursue making this.

But I wish everyone good luck with the contest!! I'm really looking forward to seeing what is chosen and play with the new expansions eventually.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have high hopes for my zombie based expansion; DRY DRIER DRIEST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh my...that sounds twisted! I've never understood people who say that Zombie theme is currently hot and being stuck in everything. Winegame with Zombie theme sounds natural!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
will that require you to sacrifice some bottles of wine to fight the horde with? do i age the wine or save my meeples from getting eaten? could be interesting.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Better yet, fulfill the right wine order to summon the Great Old One CTHULU!!! and watch him devour the grapes of your competition along with the souls of their workers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D'OH!

Can't believe I missed this - and I had such a good idea in mind as well (truffle hunting)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry James! The contest just ended. You can subscribe to our newsletter so that you know about future contests. www.stonemaiergames.com

Hopefully it will do well, and encourage a second batch/contest (for which I would most certainly submit an entry, old chap )

Hilo ID 1000170:
1) can you have multiple grapes in your crush pad with the same value.

2) do grapes and wine get more valuable the year they are harvested or crushed as well. e.g. I harvest my Pinot card at the end of the year they will go from 1 to 2 in value, right?

3) please explain the crusher visitor card because it seems way over powered. My wife used it to turn a 3 value white grape into a 8 blush and filled a wine order.

Thanks in advance for your help.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) No. If the space already has a marker, new grapes you are harvesting get moved down in value by 1.

2) Yes.

3) What does the card say?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Crush Expert: Crush grapes into any or all types of wine and draw 1 █.
Crusher: Crush grapes into any or all types of wine.

Both these cards allow you to crush multiple types of wine at one time. They are powerful if used at the right time. However you still have to obey the rules of making wine. A 3 white grape can't magically become a 8 blush wine on its own. You still need an additional 5 red grape to mix with it.

Types of wine:
White: 1 white grape becomes 1 white wine of the same value.
Red: 1 red grape becomes 1 red wine of the same value.
Blush: 1 white grape plus 1 red grape becomes 1 blush wine of the combined value.
Sparkling: 1 white grape plus 2 red grapes becomes 1 sparkling wine of the combined value.

You also need the correct cellar to put the wine in. An 8 blush wine requires a large cellar, for example.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joshua--For the crusher card (or any other card that involves any mechanic in the game), you still have to follow the rules of the game. You can't turn a 3-value white grape into an 8-value blush wine--that's not within the construct of the game. Normally when you crush, you make one type of wine. The bonus the crusher gives you is that with that one action, you can make any or all types of wine. So it's pretty much an enhanced crush action.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks all for your timely response.

Jamey I really enjoyed the toast. Btw not that I care my name is butchered all the time but my name is pronounced come-o it rhymes with bureau or Thoreau and I'm from mish-a-wak-a (short a sounds). It was hilarious on the toast hearing mish-a-ka-wa. It's all good it must have been heineken. Thanks a lot for all your work on the euphoria campaign. Viticulture is really fun too have three plays under my belt but most importantly the wife loves it too. Thanks again. This is cd josh just FYI. I'm sure the all the names run together.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"come-o" That makes much more sense. Sorry about that! There was alcohol involved.

Oh, I know it's CD Josh, or as I like to say, Really Talented Musician Josh. I'm glad to hear your wife likes the game!

I really like Viticulture. I played it at Origins and I had to buy a copy right away.

But what's up with the non-standard box size? It's more or less the small Alea box size (Louis XIV), but about twice as deep. And there's no reason whatsoever for it since it's all empty space.

I imagine it was cheaper to manufacture it that way, but I really wish it could have been thinner. I could have fit two games in that space on the bookshelf instead

I really hope Euphoria has a more appropiatedly-sized box without much wasted space.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mine is full almost to the top, although I did get the KS edition so there if more stuff in the box.

Edit: I believe the Dev (Jamey) has some expansions planned so maybe he left room to put everything in the base game box
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noel--The box is that deep because it was required to fit all the Kickstarter-exclusive items in the box. Also, it was designed lengthwise and widthwise to fit snugly inside of a medium flat-rate shipping box.

1) can I place more than one meeple in a season. e.g. I have three meeples. can I place them all summer season and just pass winter season? how do I place them all? I place one other players place one comes back to me I place another etc.

2) can I place more than one meeple on an area of the board to get the middle bonus like in a three player game?

3) when I harvest grapes do I place the grape cards back in my hand?

4) how exactly does the yoke work I place a worker there to build it and then to use it I place a worker there?

thanks in advance this game is really fun I am just new to euro's. thanks again.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. You place all of your meeples during the year. If you choose to place them all in summer, you won't have any for winter. There is no restriction on placing meeples other than available worker spaces.

2. See above

3. There are no grape cards. You harvest grapes from vines which remain planted after harvesting.

4. You build the yoke by taking a build action. You may then use the space once a year, and the action you take depends on whether you placed the worker on the yoke space in the winter or he summer.

Hope this helps.

Hi,

I already posted this in the Arboriculture forum, but I fear there are only a few users reading and my request is urgend.

So I appologize and post it twice:

Can I place every year only one worker on the whole arboriculture board or can I place one worker on each of the actions it offers?

If I plant a tree on a field, can I still plant wine, too, or can I only use two field for wine when I planted a tree?

Thanks a lot, tonight will be my first game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can place a single worker in as many spots on the expansion board as you have available per turn. You don't have to choose just one spot each turn. Also notice that most of the spaces, if not all of them, are outlined in both yellow and blue so you can take those actions in summer or winter.

Yes. You can still have grape vines up to the total value of 6, as well as 1 arbor card (Apple Tree, Tomato Vine, Olive Tree) per field.

Q: If the Handyman converts a trellis into something else, does it affect any of the vines planted that require a trellis? If so, what happens to them? Same question with regard to converting the irrigation to something else.

Q: Can you place more than one of your workers onto the yoke space on your board during a year? Seems like you should be able to place on in Summer for the uproot action, and one in winter to harvest.

Thanks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Those requirements are only for planting so you wouldn't lose the vines.

2) No, it is one space and you have to weigh your decision accordingly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What he said.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indeed, what he said.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Followup Handyman question:

Can you use the Handyman to upgrade the Medium Cellar to the Large Cellar?

My personal answer to that is no, but I'd be curious to see what others think.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the official FAQ:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would like to ask why in the end of the year you must discard down to 7 cards? May i discard 1,2,3 or no card? and any card?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dmitris--Hi, thanks for your question. It's just a basic hand-limit rule. 7 cards is the hand limit, so you must have no more than 7 cards when you start each new year.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This question came up the first time we played the game as well, so I was glad to see it answered here.

I don't know much about growing grapes, but is there a thematic explanation behind this? In real life, is it true that a trellis is only needed for the planting, and can be removed from a planted vine at a later point?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ender: That's a great question, and it's part of the reason we'll be updating the Handyman for the second edition. It doesn't work thematically, and it creates confusion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Jamey, the revised version of this card certainly is easier to understand, and I like the concept of it:

Handyman: All players may build 1 structure at a $2 discount. You gain 1 VP for each other player who does this.

Hi !

I really don't like the rule of aging the grapes at the end of the year (+1 to the grape's value), because it doesn't seem logical and realistic for me.

Wouldn't it be better to keep the same value for the grapes or even to reduce their value (reflecting grape's decay) at the end of the year ? What's your opinion about that ?

Also, is it normal that the value of grapes exceeds the capacity of the cellar while wine tokens can't do ?

Thanks for your answers.
Fabien.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've always thought of it as aging the wine in barrels which is thematic. Granted, the wine is usually blended before it's aged, so the order of things is screwy.

I know the designer has commented about grapes aging. The change was made to maintain the design.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just like you never let the truth ruin a good story, playability should outweigh fact on occasion in board games.

The fact is you are spot on...but doing this would slow the game down well beyond the intended scope. and Also adding 2 pinot grapes and a syrah together doesn't inherently make a better wine than one that game from just one Pinot vine.

Heck it's even in the Twilight Struggle rulebook. In some cases where realism and playability clash they side with playability.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fabien--The early versions of Viticulture (during playtesting) had grapes not aging, because, as you said, it's not thematically correct. In fact, the earliest version made players discard grapes they didn't use after a full year passed, indicating that they had gone bad. So if you didn't crush grapes that year, you lost all grapes you had harvested. That wasn't fun at all.

So we changed it so you didn't lose the grapes, but that they didn't age...and that didn't work either, because those grapes blocked new grapes from getting onto the crushpad.

Finally we made the un-thematic decision to make the grapes age, and it works so, so much better. Not only is the game more fun that way, but it also leads to more strategy in terms of the value of the vines you plant (so that they don't overlap with one another when you harvest) and the timing of when you decide to crush.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ok thanks for your answer !
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great to see this thread - we were also wondering whether aging the grapes was thematic.

I'm curious to hear from someone who knows more about real-life wine-making than I do (I'm pretty clueless about the process). How does this work in real life? i.e. how quickly are grapes normally crushed and turned into wine? Can they be stored at all? Or does the wine-making process have to happen fairly promptly after grapes are picked? Is this a matter of days/weeks/months?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grapes are crushed pretty much immediately after being harvested. Crush is the craziest season for wineries. "Crush" being the weeks long season when grapes are harvested and crushed.

You can smell it for miles around. It's a wonderful slightly sour fruit smell that wafts through the grape growing valleys.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sometimes (but only sometimes and not every time I play, depending of the group I'm playing with), I apply the HR of aging the grapes in the other direction, downgrading all of them -1 from their value at the end of the year. It seems to work fine as well, also thematically could be correct.
I own the Essential Edition.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This would simply prolong the game and encourage people to harvest as late as possible, so I don't see the appeal. Plus you can almost never have a grape that is 4+ unless you get lucky with your vine card draw.

How long does a game where grape aged realistically last?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I love viticulture, especially with the Tuscany expansion; But the unthematic wine making part does kind of bother me. Maybe instead of the actions harvest grapes (and storing them in crush pads) and making wine (transfering them to cellars), it could be Making wine (storing them in barrels and/or tanks) and then bottling the wine (thus making them ready for sale). This way, they could age in both. Something should be done about the mixing red and white grapes to make blush too...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the common ways to make blush wine is by mixing red and white grapes.

As for grapes aging, sometimes we have to make an unthematic choice for a game to be fun. We tested the game the other way, and it wasn't fun. Glaucio, your solution is clever and would work fine (it's just a few years too late to make a change like that ).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, it's a really clever idea.

Jamey, we need a new Viticulture: Essential and Extra Thematic Edition .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Played this game for the first time last night with my wife. Loved it, although this was my first question too. Love this thread. We are now going to imagine that the crush pad is actually 'barrels' and the crush action is really 'bottling'. Which means that the poor guy doing the 'harvest' action is punching well above his weight.

(And the lucky guy doing the 'bottling' has it pretty cruisy.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've been playing it with 2 and 3 players now for a little bit and definitely with 3 players we found that the speed is decently high in that one could tap upon 25 points with some clever visitor cards or high orders before the others hardly had set up an economy. Smart play and good win one could say, and it is also how the game is, but I was mainly wondering reading the above if it's mainly slowing down the game if the grapes don't age or degrade in the crushpad (which might not be an issue in our games so far) or if you'll run into other issues as well? Also, now it feels a bit strange to being able to age your grapes higher than your cellarsize. Anyway, just wondering since many post "it could be nice to..." But I couldn't really find any reports if it actually worked ;-)

Disclaimer: This is my first review, so I probably won't do a very good job, but bear with me and hopefully someone will find this blurb useful. This is also based on one 4-player game. In addtion, I was one of the few that got the 30 Kickstarter versions in the Euphoria Kickstarter, so there might be some minor differences in the retail version.

The Review

Production Quality
So, I'm no expert in this area, but the production quality is amazing, especially in terms of customization. All the pieces (with the exception of the glass markers for wine/grapes) are wood and customized into different shapes. Each of the buildings has their own marker shape, so instead of using generic cubes and cylinders (there is one cylinder), you have a different shaped marker:
- Wine Bottle for residual income (earned yearly income from completing wine orders)
- Cylinder (cork) for VP track
- Rooster for wake up track
- Custom meeples for workers
- Different building shapes for each of the Yoke, Cellars, Cottage, Tasting Room, Windmill, Trellis, and Irrigation tower.
- Plus a custom first player marker (grapes)

The glass markers are nice and heavy and they're clear so you can see what part of the track you're on.

The boards are double-sided, with one side with text with descriptions for beginners and a nice cleaner one without such descriptions for those who prefer it. I really like the art on those as well. It also has a play order reference on the side with writing which is a great reminder for players.

The cards are good quality stock and the art is beautiful on them too. The box art is also beautiful in a subtle way, but that also means that it's not something that would easily catch your eye if you're just randomly browsing. The box sleeve I got with the KS version is also nice, since it looks like a wooden wine casket (with wine stains and everything). There's also a nice plastic insert inside the box that will keep small pieces customized (most of the small pieces come inside plastic bags and there were extras, so you won't have any loose small pieces around).

The only gripe (although a minor one) I kind of have is with the box itself, mainly with the shape. Although I do understand that it was made to fit inside shipping boxes, it is irregular shaped, so it kind of sticks out with other games on a shelf. Also, the box is a little too deep, which makes it kind of a pain to remove the game board and instruction booklets since they fit so snugly in the box. Even if you put those on top, they're still about a cm from the top and so it's not as easy to take out. If you happen to put those in first, then that's more of a pain to take out. Still, those are minor and don't detract from the game.

Basic Premise
The basic premise is that each player runs a vineyard and the goal is to get the most Victory Points. When someone reaches 20 VP, you will finish off the year and whoever has the most VP wins. The game runs in "years", which is split into four seasons: Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter. Spring is where one determines the turn order for the whole year. Summer has certain summer actions (such as planting, building, and playing summer visitor cards). Fall allows each player to draw one summer or one winter visitor card. Winter allows players with remaining workers (a worker used in the summer can't be reused in the winter) to do some winter actions (such as harvesting, making wine via crushing, or playing winter visitor cards).

In general, you are performing actions that a vineyard would do. The mechanics are mostly realistic (other than the aging grapes thing), so you really feel like you're running a vineyard.

Victory Points are generally earned by fulfilling wine orders, but you can also earn some from Summer/Winter visitor cards, placement of your workers on some actions in a 3+ player game, or placing your rooster on 6 of the Wakeup Track.

Gameplay
I'm not going to go too deeply into this, but Viticulture is medium-light Euro game. It is basically a worker placement game with a variable turn order based on the Wakeup Track and some randomness based on cards. Some highlights:

- Wakeup Track. First player moves in a clockwise direction, but that only determines turn order in deciding what your turn order will be in the round. Turn order for the rest of the year is based on which spot of the Wakeup Track you place your rooster. In general, the later you go, the more powerful the bonus you get: Spot #1 no bonus, Spot #2 draws a vine card, Spot #3 draws a wine order card, Spot #4 gains 1 Lira, Spot #5 draws either a summer or winter visitor card, Spot #6 gives 1 VP, Spot #7 gives a temporary worker that can be used for the year. There is quite a bit of strategy on this mechanic alone, where you weigh earlier actions vs. better bonuses.

- Simple choices. Some worker placements have complex actions on certain spots, which allows for some advanced strategy. However, that kind of feature makes people more prone to Analysis Paralysis. In this game, it's simple, and so I find that the game moves quickly without too much Analysis Paralysis coming into play. So it's definitely a great gateway game and more appealing to casual players.

- In 3+ player games, some spots give bonuses (either drawing/playing extra cards, giving an extra VP, or giving a player 1 Lira, thus making things more profitable or cheaper to do). This gives an element of strategy and really encourages people to go earlier in lieu of a smaller bonus on the Wakeup Track.

- Every building you build has a use, which also increases strategy. Some are needed to plant certain vines (Trellis and Irrigation), some give VP bonuses when doing certain actions (Windmill and Tasting Room), some gives an extra bonus (Cottage for extra card in Fall, and Yoke for extra flexibility in working your fields), and finally you can expand your cellars to hold more valuable wine.

- Summer and Winter cards vary in usefulness. Actually all of them have some degree of usefulness (even those that exchange VP for something else), but some are clearly much better than others. The Wine and Vine cards are similar, although most Vines are at least okay. Some of the Wine cards are really hard to fulfill. In some ways this is a con, but this kind of happens with any "random" mechanic. I've seen a lot of games that are a lot more imbalanced though, so this is more like a minor con.

- Money is tight at the beginning, but has little use at the end. This is a con really. At some point you will be rolling in money from residual income and you find that it has no use other than a tiebreaker at the end. I hope that in future expansions, there is some more use for money though.

- Very little "screw you" factor. Actually, other than taking a spot to block someone else, I don't really think there is one. Most Summer/Winter visitor cards affect you alone, and of the few that affect others, it's mostly giving them a bonus action that will either give you extra draws or extra VP. Of course, this also plays into the lightness of it and makes it a good gateway game.

- Different number of players will play vastly differently. Because the number of available action spots increase at 3 and 5 players, you'll have a better chance of playing your actions in a game with an odd number of players. With an even number of players, I think the game will be tighter and you'll have to think in terms of two year plans to do some things just because you aren't likely to be able to get everything you want to do in a single given year just due to the fewer action spots. However, the Wakeup Track will also behave differently. With fewer players, a lot of the higher bonuses won't ever be picked because you are fighting for action spots and generally want to go earlier. But with more players and more action spaces, it might be more worth the risk to act later and grab the better bonus, since you have a decent chance of snagging one of the three action spots in a 5+ player game. It may also force you to vary your strategy a bit.

Strategy
The most obvious strategy is to draw vine cards, build the Trellis and Irrigation, plant vines, harvest, build some bigger cellars, crush, and then fulfill wine orders. It's a decent strategy, but you're going to get blocked a lot. The cellars are expensive (4 and 6, respectively and ~90% of wine orders require at least a medium cellar, so you'll need to either sell grapes or do wine tours) and you'll need 3 build actions (4 if you build the yoke to allow you to uproot and an extra, unblockable harvest), a whole lot of plant, harvest, and crush, and fulfill actions. And you'll probably get frustrated if you don't get useful Summer/Winter Visitor cards. In general, the three friends I played with last night were more or less doing this.

Another possible strategy is to do the opposite and to not fulfill orders. Difficult, but still viable (build Windmill to get 1 VP when you plant in a year; build the Tasting Room for 1 VP when doing a tour in a year; pick #6 on the Wakeup Track). That's 3 VP/year so after 7 (plus how many years it takes to build those two for 11 Lira), you're done. It works, but is so obvious, it is so easily blockable (people low on money and reliant on wine orders like to do the tour, and everyone is fighting for the same building spots). Also you're not blocking other people's strategies at all, so you may not make it in time.

Relying on cards is a gamble, since they can vary so much. A couple of my friends tried building the Cottage to draw an extra card, but I found that 2/3 of their hands were Summer/Winter Visitor cards and apparently they weren't moving very fast.

So what does one do? I say, do everything. Try to get extra workers early and then adjust what you're going to do based on the cards you draw. I did that last night and I won by 8 VPs (or maybe 6 VP, I don't remember) at 22 VP (admittedly, I did have some good cards). The breakdown of my points were (not necessarily in that order):
- 2 VP from two people training workers near the beginning of the game when I played Guest Speakers (Winter Visitor)
- 4 VP from uprooting a 4 grape card using Horticulturist (Summer Visitor).
- 1 VP from selling grapes using the 1 VP spot
- 2 VP from building a windmill and planting a vine in two different years
- 2 VP from discarding a 6 value wine from my medium cellar using Judge (Winter Visitor)
- 2 VP from discarding 4 cards (including a 5 VP one I was working on) using Auctioneer (Summer Visitor)
- 2 VP from having two fields with vines using Surveyor (Summer Visitor)
- 6 VP from fulfilling two wine orders of 3 VP each (one 6 value red and one 6 value white)
- 1 VP for fulfilling wine order using the 1 VP spot (was the move that pushed me over from 18 to 22)

I won in about 10 years, was rolling in money at the end (I had at least 12 lira), and I only built the Trellis, Irrigation, Windmill and Medium Cellar. That's it. Sure, I used five cards, but they were a mix of summer/winter and required some wine-making and vine planting. I was "blocked" a lot, but because I diversified my actions (and planned a few different actions and was okay with doing certain actions the next year), I was able to take advantage of the wildly different cards. I actually jumped from 2 VP to 22 VP in like a 4 year span. I also never resorted to sending anyone to the "Gain 1 Lira for help" spot, even though I had 6 workers from year 3 or 4 onwards (Trained in Year 1, used Guest Speakers as well in Year 1, used Teacher in Year 2 or 3). Note that this was a 4 player game, and I never had a Yoke, so it's obvious that I had planned my moves well and diversified.

Conclusion
I think it's a great game. There are a few shortcomings (money being useless late in the game, and the cards being wildly different in power ), but it's still a well thought out game, with a lot of hidden depth and strategy.

Games will play differently depending on the number of players. Even-numbered players will probably be tighter affairs because you'll get blocked a lot, but with good planning you shouldn't be set back much. Odd-numbered players will have a more open game since they're more able to do actions they want on a turn, and sometimes even more than once. Depending on how you play and whether you prefer like feeling you're making progress or if you like tight games, you'll probably want to adjust the number of players.

Although it is a medium-light Euro on the surface, it's deceptively light and there's quite a bit of strategy involved to mitigate getting "useless" cards as well as getting "blocked". Playing adaptively will actually allow you to put more cards to better use and let you waste fewer moves, and that is something many won't realize when they first look at it.

So I rate it a 9 (And I apologize for my rambling review).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's a good first review. I also have a copy (minus the expansion) and have played it a couple of times with both even and odd player counts. I like this game a lot. I think it's always tight no matter how many players.

I also appreciate your take on a few basic strategies this early on in the review. Nice job!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just played my first game of this last night with 4 players and actually quite enjoyed it. My first few turns involved pulling a load of uncertified staff. This led to me losing 5 vps and being on -5 but having both the trellis and irrigation built, the medium cellar built and an extra person while still having my starting money.

The others were laughing at my vineyard full of illegal immigrant workers and dodgy buildings. However, it turns out capitalism won in the end and my policy of ignoring health and safety regs and hiring vast numbers of staff on pitiful wages paid off. With me winning by about 7 points on my first play. Albeit 3 of us were noobies and only the game owner had played before. She came 3rd though much to our amusement. She'd been drinking away the profits no doubt!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 995776:
I got a review copy of Viticulture, and here’s what I think of it. I wasn’t a part of the wildly successful Kickstarter campaign, so I’m unbiased by that.

The game: Viticulture by Jamey Stegmaier and Alan Stone, published by Stonemaier Games in 2013 after a successful Kickstarter campaign.

Elevator pitch: A worker-placement game where you develop a vineyard in Tuscany: plant vines, harvest grapes, crush them into wine and then sell that wine, while managing your workers and money.

What's in the box? Lots of stuff, in an unusually high box. Beautiful boards (common board and player boards), several decks of cards and really groovy meeple sets for each players, with unique and unusual custom meeples. Components of this game are very nice (except for the fact that almost every single component says "Sponsored by…").
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What do you do in the game? Game proceeds in years. Main action happens in summer and winter, when you place workers to plant vines, harvest grapes, crush them into wine and fill wine orders. There are also cards you can play to make your actions more efficient or to gain other benefits. There are limited spaces for actions, so turn order can be critical.

Lucky or skillful? Mostly skill, but there's a luck element in the cards. The visitor cards, which give you benefits and make your actions more efficient, can be quite powerful – in some situations. If you draw cards that do not fit your situation, tough luck. The key here is to adapt, and of course you can aim to draw more cards, to make the odds of getting good cards better. Nevertheless – a good card in the right place can make a big difference, and there's some luck to that.

Abstract or thematic? The wine theme does make sense: the process of planting vines, harvesting grapes, crushing them and so on flows well. There's of course the usual worker placement gripe – why can't I harvest my vines, just because those other guys harvested first? If you can get over that somehow, the theme works well. The beautiful art helps here as well.

Solitaire or interactive? This is a constructive game. There's no way to attack your opponents. The game would be fairly heavily in the solitaire end, except for the theme-breaking limited opportunities to do actions. Those are the key source of interaction in the game. You'll have to think about what your opponents are going to do and just how early you need to be on the turn order if you want to do what you need to do. I like low interaction, and I found the level of interaction in this game quite pleasing.

Players: 2–6. I'd say the game is best with 3 or 4 players (haven't tried the two-player game, though), but it does work with five or six. That's quite well done. Six-player game with all new players is not the best way to play the game for the first time, though, as it can drag a bit if players don't know what to do.

Who can play? Stonemaier Games suggests 10+. Not for small children, this one, clearly, and my kids aren't old enough to say whether that 10+ is true. The theme will probably put kids off anyway. Experienced board gamers will have no problems with this. Viticulture is not particularly heavy, and the game flow is fairly simple, so I wouldn't be too worried about introducing this to casual or occasional gamers, either. Even non-gamers with an open mind and an interest for the wine theme might make a good audience for the game.

Length: Box says 60 minutes and Jamey Stegmaier says that can be true for six-player games as well. Don't count on that. Our first game took almost two hours (but didn't particularly drag at any point), and a second three-player game took well over an hour. A slow player will slow down the game a lot, as there are plenty of small actions, and if each action takes a while to think… With fast players and some more experience, 45–60 minutes is probably a realistic timeframe, but not with new players. Also, the game is over when a player reaches 20 points, and I think experienced players will generally finish the games in fewer turns as they are more efficient. The exact moment of the ending can be a surprise, which is fun, as opposed to all those other games with set amount of rounds.

What's to like: Beautiful art and a meaningful, interesting theme; clever worker placement mechanism with a fluid turn order mechanism; making powerful, efficient card plays; playing with up to six players; the way the game is quite productive and constructive, even when you lose you feel like you achieved something.

What's not to like: Luck element inherent in the cards, and the frustration of drawing currently-useless cards, like very difficult wine orders in the early game; it's yet another worker placement game that adds relatively little to the genre and just combines the best ideas from other games; "why I can't harvest my vines just because those guys did it first?" effect.

My verdict: I wouldn't have bought the game myself; I'm not particularly keen on worker placement games. Viticulture is more evolution than revolution: I don't think it brings much new to the genre, just combines good mechanisms from other games. Well done, that's quite something, and I think Viticulture does it well. After my first game, the game felt a bit random, and the cards seemed overly powerful. After the second game, everything clicked better. The cards are powerful, yes, but that's just why you have to make sure you draw enough cards to get the ones that are good for you.

I don't think Viticulture is a must-try, but for those who are interested in the wine-making theme, it's certainly worth checking out. For the fans of worker placement genre it's another solid game in the genre, with some new ideas and an interesting combination of old ideas. If you don't like worker placement games, on the other hand, I don't think Viticulture is going to change that.

On the scale of Enthusiastic, Suggest, Indifferent or Avoid, Viticulture gets Suggest for now, but I can see eventually dropping my rating to Indifferent once I've had enough – this is not a keeper for me, but something I'll enjoy for a while – probably quite enough to justify the price, had I bought this – then move on.

See all

Hi Mikko

Thank you for a well written and succinct review, I really like your review format.

I'm more enthusiastic about the game than you are, but that's subjective so I'm not going to argue the point .

Regarding 2-player games: I've only played the game with two players so far and have enjoyed it a lot as have both the other players I've tried it with.

Regards

at the end of year


after receiving residual payment, return wine bottle token to middle symbol or remain?


thx for your answer in advance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It remains because you keep getting residual payments after every year. So it only goes up.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you get more than 5 lira a year for residual payments, how are y'all indicating that? So far I have been turning the bottle on its side and kept going around the track.

i misunderstand the rule?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You replace three grape tokens by one sparkling wine token.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
so i keep the other white? the phrase excess token it refers to what exactly?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your three tokens (red 2 and red 3 and white 2) become one token (sparkling 7) so the other two tokens are discarded.

All your other tokens are unaffected.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's correct. Thanks Eric and Simon!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was also puzzled by the term 'excess'. Doesn't suit the definition in this case IMO:

1. an amount of something that is more than necessary, permitted, or desirable

I would rather use 'converted' or 'used' token.

Just paid closer attention to the cards and noticed one card from the promo deck being a bit different shade. Is this only with my deck?

I just played this with my wife for the first time tonight, and while it was only the first game it took us about 2.5 hours for rules and gameplay. Probably close to 2 hours of which was gameplay. I'm confident this can be dropped to sub 90 mins with our next play, but I'm somewhat nervous about the thought of trying to teach and play with 4 or 6 players with it taking as long as it did tonight.

How long does it normally take you to play this game with X number of players?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Played first time yesterday with a friend, and with game rules explanation and game play, it took us about two and half hours too.
But it was our first play, I think that it can be reduced, in a couple of games (for a two player game), for 1 hour 1 hour and a quarter at most!

Cheers!

p.s: liked the game, but a 2 player game is not the best number in this case. The end was abrupt, too abrupt! but it was the first game...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've taught the game a lot recently, with 4, 5 and 6 players. Average play time was:
4-player: 1.5 hrs
5-player: 1.75 hrs
6-player: 2.25 hrs

Last month a friend showed me Viticulture, a game I was tempted to purchase but was unsure whether I would find it too light for my tastes. Well, I must say it was the second kickstart game I liked and it was even better than the other one (
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
). After purchasing it and a fast delivery, I introduced the game to two other friends who loved and demanded a second game after the learning session. .Unfortunately, my copy did not come with the expansions (arboriculture and kickstart cards) so I want to purchase them ASAP. Do they have any schedule to be released this year? And where can I find them, please?

Overall, my impression is pretty positive and the production is of a very high quality with few minor issues (no need to have such a big 5-lyra coin; my sharp-eyed girlfriend told me the printer cut from one of the coin frames was slightly unaligned - it doesn't bug me at all, but she has a critical eye for these things, so who am I to judge?). The art is really, really great!

Regarding the rules, when my friend showed me the game, he played it with some modifications he read on BGG (IIRC) and would like to know if there is any consensus about them and if the author has manifested his opinion:

1) "The Cottage building is too powerful".

Perhaps reducing its cost to 3 lyra and letting you look both visitor cards (blue/yellow) on fall, choosing one and discarding the other?

2) "Change the Spring bonus of 1 Lyra to 2 Lyra."

IMHO, It seems a bit too weak, considering its space in the turn order. I wouldn't complain if it located on position #2 (between no bonus and bonus vine card)

3) "Horticulturist - Maximum award: 2 VP for uprooting a vine card of value:4, 1 VP for lower numbered vines "

On the second game, a friend had a decisive edge with the original card, so I am tempted to accept this.

4) "Guest speaker: Maximum award: 2 VP"

I don't know this card. My copy doesn't have it so I suppose it's one of the kickstart promotional cards?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Victor--Thanks for your comments! Yes, we're hoping to put an expansion pack on Kickstarter in 2014 that will include Kickstarter exclusives from the original campaign, including promo cards and the Arboriculture expansion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for the fast reply, mr. Stegmaier. So, the expansions will be released only at 2014? Pity, I was hoping they would be available at 2013, since both entries on BGG were marked for this year . Anyway, keep up the great work!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Victor--Oh, the Arboriculture expansion has already been released...but only to Kickstarter backers. The full expansion pack that we're planning hasn't been put on BGG yet.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'd like to mention that not the cottage, but the "play visitor" bonus actions are changed with the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. You no longer may play a second visitor card, but increase the morale of your workers one step.

And yes, the cottage is powerful. But it does not help you dircetly in achieving the goal (20 VPs). Other expensive Buildings like the Mill or the Tasting Room generate VPs for you! I can imagine a quite good strategy implementing the Tasting Room and giving a tour every turn... So, there are other strong buildings, too. :-)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I disagree. Getting money is difficult in the game. Taking an action (Giving a tour) generates you 2 or 3 money. That is not much. So a bonus on the turn order just to get you money is strong just because of the money alone!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hehe, I like the card as it is. I used it twice to jump to the finish line - but didn't win the games! Yes, it is very good, generating VPs out of nothing (more or less) - but on the other hand you have to play it early in the round (summer phase) so all players already know you are going for the win. So everybody can react to it...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't know...

Anyway: Since you like to change the card or the cost of the cottage: Perfect! Just use the stickers that are coming with the game!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hmm... I didn't know about the Arboriculture effect on the play card bonus action. Putting this way, it weakens the Cottage in a way the accumulation of cards doesn't seem so powerful. I understand the logic of the direct vp conversion too, a friend of mine steamrolled on the last game buiding both the windmill and the tasting room early.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perhaps I overreacted then, but even then I am not strongly opposed to mantaining the 1 Lyra bonus as it is. Perhaps a couple of more plays will change my impression?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In my case, he played in the last round of the game and we already know the match would end on that very turn and he was well confortable with his well-stocked cellar . This is the only point I really disagree with your post, but again, it may be well be too early to jump into conclusions. I will play a couple more games to check it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry, but what stickers? My copy didn't come with any, though it had a nice "fiber" bag (sorry for the descriptive term, don't know how to exactly address it) with it, which I hadn't a use for it so far.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The bag is for the glass stones, or so I've been told.

In the KS version of the game, there's a small slip of stickers to modify the game components according to your needs (like Almecho said, for example putting a "two money" sticker on the turn order table and such).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's the only game component for which it would make sense...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I see. Well, I find nice of the author to provide stickers in case you want to change the values, and the bag will be put into use. The product quality overall is really, really good for a kickstart game. I suppose the total pledge was quuite satisfactory.

How have you organized the box insert?

I've seen many images of removed inserts with custom storage solutions, but there are people who always do this. Have you been able to use the insert to store everything that's included?

I find the holes for every player color awkardly sized. They just fit in with the ziplock bags they came in but if you use the bigger zips they don't fit. If you don't use a bag it's hard to grope all the pieces from the hole.

The holes that hold the cards are quite deep and I'd rather have the player color holders this deep. Also there are only spaces for three decks which isn't enough for the Arboriculture expansion but this is understandable as it's expansion.

Then come the two semi big slots. Can't with the glass tokens in the rustic bag in either of them. Can't hold all the money tokens either. Can hold the extra Arboriculture stuff, but where do I put rest of them?


So, have I just failed with the box insert and haven't understood how to efficiently store the pieces or is there something wrong with it?

(Ramblings from work, don't have the box here so I hope I remember the amount of slots in the insert correctly.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Funny - I consider this a very useful insert (and usually I'm the one who throws inserts away). The cards even fit with sleeves on!

My box looks like this (sans zip-locks):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's what I do:

I store the order deck in one slot, the visitor decks in another slot, and the vines/arbiculture decks in the last slot.

I store the 1 Lira tokens in the burlap bag, which fits snugly in one of the large compartments.

I store the glass tokens in a ziplock bag, which fits snugly in the other large compartment.

I store the 5 Lira tokens, free ranging, in one of the six small compartments. I store the 2 Lira tokens, free ranging, in two of the six small compartments.

I store the start player, temp worker, and arbiculture heart cardboard tokens in a small ziplock bag within one of the small compartments.

Each set of player pieces is stored in a ziplock bag, all of which are placed on top of the game boards.

So two small compartments are not used.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- All cards in the card slots. Can be stored flat or on the long edge.
- All player pieces in their holes, using the provided bags. Just align the bag over the hole, then press on the center of the bag using one finger.
- The glass beads in the burlap bag fit in the large opening if you fold under the top of the bag.
- Arboriculture stuff in the other large opening.
- Put all boards on top of the insert.
- Put rules on top of the boards.
- Put bag of money on top of the rules.
- Close box.

Everything fits quite snug.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Impressive thing about the insert is that it fits with sleeved cards! First time I've seen this being done correctly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ooh, didn't realize you can put the cards horizontally AND vertically, now that's handy and now I understand.

Thanks for the tips, here's how I did it! I decided to go without the ziplocks after all...

So I read in the FAQ, that the the Grande Worker may be worked into the second edition of the game, is there going to be a way for 1st edition owners to just pick up a set of the Grande Workers? A majority of our plays are going to be 2 player games, and I like the idea of using the Grande Worker in that setting.

Thanks and we love the game so far!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BK--Well, the nice thing about grande workers is that you can use meeples from any game to represent them (they don't look the same as the regular workers). Each player begins the game with one grande worker and two regular workers. That will be my recommendation for existing Viticulture owners, and I'll include the original grande meeples on a future Viticulture Kickstarter project.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For now we will just use a different color as the Grande Worker since we have 4 extra sets usually sitting around being that we'll play with two players most of the time, but it is good to know there may be a way in the future for us to pick up a set of them, just for us folks that like things to match just a bit too much.

We were wondering about Entertainer (use four workers, pay two wine: gain 4 points). Is it really a good card? It sounds quite weak, even though 4 points is a fairly large amount in this game. Have you used this card to good effect?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have not used, nor do I remember anyone using, this card. In and of itself, that may speak to how bad the card is, I don't know.

Using 5 workers (one to activate the summer card space in addition to the four required by the card) and two wine to get four victory points sounds like discard fodder to me. This appears to me to be a tremendously inefficient use of resources.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi,

In the Endgame it is a quiet good card. Its the only way to convert workers into VPs. I ever used the card when i got them.

Atti
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fair enough. I believe that it might be a game ender for someone. The problem is, it would seem to be very bad in most other situations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FWIW, there seems to be a lot of people saying that the cards are not balanced. The designer (and many other users) defend this notion by saying that ALL the cards are intentionally situational; that is, they are weak in some circumstances and strong in others.

The cards appear to dictate one's strategy in this game (increasing replayability).

I don't have any game play experience yet, but I thought I'd report on what I see as a common line of thought in these forums.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've seen two games won by its use. In one of those, the winning player also woke up late for the temp worker.

It tends to reward players who invest heavily in extra workers, workers that would otherwise tend to get hired out at year end. With a 1st year red and a 1st year white, it can be a very good use for four extra workers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I lost to this card yesterday. The winner played entertainer, wedding party and filled one wine order for 12 points on the final round.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ouch!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the feedback, everybody. So looks like this card can be quite powerful in the right circumstances. Just not something you'd like to have in your hand early in the game...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is a tempting card to use, and as others have said can be used to great effect, especially if you have a lot of workers and can grab additional victory points the same year.

I have also used it to bad effect once or twice!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is actually a card that used to be TOO powerful. (See here http://www.stonemaiergames.com/summer-visitor-13-entertainer...) As said before in this thread, if you go worker heavy strategy you can jump to a surprise finish with this comboed up with a wine order.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, just today, on the last turn of the game, I first played Entertainer and Tour Guide for 5 points and 4 money, then in Winter I sold wine for 6+1 point. Too bad this 11-point leap was not enough for first place.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To ensure that the discussion of this thread is complete, it's worth mentioning that the Entertainer is one of three cards that will be changed in the second edition, presumably to address concerns like the ones mentioned above. It will now read:

Entertainer: Pay $5 to draw 3 visitor cards OR discard 1 wine token and 3 visitor cards to gain 3 VP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Ender. That's actually going to be $4 for 3 winter visitor cards--I'll adjust it on the page.

That was all.

Congrats!

It's really a great game! A good choice!

Glad you were able to snag a copy. I just read on a Euphoria update that the entire first print run of Viticulture has sold out. That means the copies currently in distribution/at retailers are all that's available.

It looks like
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
adds quite a bit to the game (6 player mat extensions, 18 arbor cards, 6 grande worker meeples, 6 morale tokens, and 1 rule book).

How essential is the Arboriculture expansion, and to what extent is the base game lacking something without it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The base game feels fully complete. It lacks nothing without Arboriculture.

EDIT: I have Arboriculture and I've played it. It's all right. So far, I prefer the base game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I really agree with this statement and actually played the base game again yesterday and had great fun.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'd say the expansion adds much to the base game.
While I am sure it works good without the expansion, the expansion adds an additional aspect to the game, which does _not_ complicate things (much), but allows additional strategies to gather VPs.

Also, it weakens the very powerful double-Visitor action!

I'd never play without it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Put me in the camp of: if you don't have it, you won't think anything is missing. But it does add some neat dimensions to the game. I've only played with the expansion once, but really enjoyed it. I suspect more serious middle-weight eurogamers would prefer the game with the expansion.

And I didn't think you needed Arboriculture to have six players.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The only thing I really like and always play with is the Grande Worker. We use it without the expansion and it helps expand strategies.

But you don't need the expansion to have the grande worker. All you need is a different shaped meeple or token in the colors being used. It replaces one of the 3 starting meeples, but the cap is still 6 workers. Then the rule is you can put this worker on a spot without the bonus and you get the bonus for that action.

I feel it speeds up play a little bit too.

Otherwise, I feel the morale track is broken as you can then easily win by being a lazy vineyard owner and win without ever producing wine. You just take the 6 spot on the wake-up chart, do tours with the wine tasting room and then just plant apples and have apples on hand to give to your workers to keep moving their morale up every year to earn a VP. You can do this with just 3 workers. This strategy easily wins in a 2 player game, but may be harder to implement with more players.

When we get Viticulture back to the table, we're going to try a variant with the expansion that doesn't use the morale track to see whether the extra crops are a good addition on their own.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't see this working more than the first time. My first game with the expansion was two player and my opponent had read your session report where you mentioned this strategy and tried to use it. Unfortunately for him, I also had read it. The result was he only was able to snag the victory point on the wake-up chart every other year,and on the years I woke up first I took the tour spot and denied him that victory point. So while he was off flying kites and eating apples, I was selling wine and including free olive oil. I think I won 22 to 15. And my workers were never very happy until near the end of the game when I had plenty of wine to hand out.

So while this strategy may work from time to time, it is definitely not a sure thing, especially if your opponent knows how to block it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am so glad to hear it! I hope as more people play it then this strategy will not be as easy to implement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
essential enough that i will not buy the game with out Arboriculture and the other items like the grande workers and such.

If Jamey wants my money he had better start working on the expansion pack. He said it would include Arboriculture and a few more expansions in a KS in the future.

I have played with and with out using a friends KS copy. I don't feel like I would have a full game without it. And believe me I really love the game and fully support it. but If i spend my money on it I want to feel like i have the full game. not the game minus 15-25% of the content.

So keeping my fingers crossed till that future KS.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stewart--The expansion Kickstarter will happen in 2014. You can wait until then to get Viticulture, but at the very best, you'll have to go a full year before you have the game in your hands. But at least your friend has it!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Doesn't make me feel much better about it.
And given how overpriced the KS copies have been selling for I'd say you have a clear message from the market what kind of demand people have for that version of the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
True...I think people might just like exclusives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Having finally played with the expansion, I don't see us playing without it. Ever.

It didn't feel like it added very much complexity wise, but it seemed to smooth out the experience quite a bit (we suspect that removing the play double card actions is a large part of it). The grande meeples add another layer of strategy and the extra ways to score points are also important (for the record, I didn't fulfill a single order, but still managed to score enough points where I could have won - the morale bumps, selling olives and a few other cards were scoring me points. I took the sell action a lot more than I ever had since I had lots of extra stuff to sell instead of my precious grapes).

The game is good without it and great with it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is another vote from someone who missed on the Kickstarter but will not buy a copy without the additional gameplay content.

I just recently backed Euphoria and am glad to see that gameplay exclusives were not included. The Grande Workers and their rules especially should have been included with the non-Kickstarter retail copies, as the 2-player game doesn't work well without them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian--You are absolutely correct. Clearly I learned my lesson and applied it when creating Euphoria. I'm looking forward to making up for the mistake with the Viticulture expansion campaign. However, as I've noted elsewhere, I will have several different versions of the game available through the campaign so that you can complete the set without duplicating anything if you were to get the core game now. Otherwise you'll have to wait at least a year to get the second edition and the expansion pack.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You don't even need apples, just use the leisure spot to move them up.

However, I don't see this as guaranteed win without something else. I've only played two games (6 and 5 players), but both were won in 7 turns. In 7 turns, you need to raise the morale twice the first turn, and once every turn thereafter (using 2/3 of your actions in the first turn and 1/3 thereafter) (1 point per turn, maybe scoring two points on one turn once), go last pretty much every turn (7 points), yet still raise enough money to get that tasting room built and used 5-6 times (3-4 times if the game ends in 8 turns). That's a lot that has to go right.

Edit: fixed morale math
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Definitely not a guaranteed win, but in my experience, it was a 2 player game and we went for 9 or 10 rounds, I think. So plenty of time to get it all done.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is exactly what we ended up doing, Sarah, excellent idea! We used a sharpie marker to designate one of the starting workers for each player as a grande worker. Worked great!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While the Arboriculture expansion doesn't seem to be essential, I would regard the grande worker as essential, as evidenced by the fact that the second edition makes it a standard part of the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're going to include the grande in every copy of Viticulture from now on, and every first-run copy of Tuscany so previous buyers can get it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If there are three people:

1. Got the KS Viticulture + gets Tuscany

2. Got the retail Viticulture + gets Tuscany

3. Gets the new 2nd printing Viticulture + Tuscany

Will these three people have exactly the same thing by the end of it? Will they all have Arboriculture (not just the grande)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not sure about Arboriculture, but group 1 will have 2 extra Summer Visitors and 2 extra Winter Visitors. Everyone should have Grande Meeples once all is said and done.

(If I'm putting words in Mr. Stegmaier's mouth I do apologize in advance)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's how it's going to look:

--Tuscany (first printing will include the 4 promo cards and grande workers)

--Tuscany Prima (everything above, plus 48 custom metal lira coins)

--Tuscany Prima Arboriculture (everything above, plus Arboriculture)

Viticulture can be added on to any of those levels. There's only one version of Viticulture now (the retail version).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamey,

Does that mean that you have to buy the coins to get the Arboriculture?

That seems backwards. I love your bling as much as the next guy, but tying getting a substantive part of the game to buying bling seems strange.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sounds great i think most completionist will want the coins anyway.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh dear. Seems like there should be a "Tuscany Arboriculture" level for those retail Viticulture owners who don't need the metal coins.

How do those cards work? Do you get 2 Lira for the "Give Tour"-Action PLUS the 4 Lira / 3 Lira of the cards?

Or do you get only the money of the card?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not an expert here, but:

Cards are "self contained", they do not have a "persistent" factor that you only get when you put your worker in another area.
So you would get only 3/4 liras when u use the "Play a Summer Card". Also if it writes "Complete an order to win 1 more point", you do not have to use "Fill Order" area, you use that card to "fill a order" without using any other worker, besides the one you used to "Play the Card"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well then they are really the most useless cards in the summer deck.
If you compare them with other visitors, for example sell grapes for twice their value, or crush grapes to any/all wine types simply saves you several actions or just generates much money.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 988998:
If you've read the forums for Viticulture here on The Geek, you'll have noticed that most players are pretty enthusiastic about the game, and it has an average rating of 7.81, which puts it in the territory of games such as Tigris & Euphrates and Race for the Galaxy. On the other hand there are also quite a few posts that criticize the game.

After reading the critiques I noticed a common trend: Most of them state that there are too few action spaces in the game. I completely disagree with this view: Yes, there are fewer spaces available for each action than there are players, but in my opinion this is good game design, not a game breaking error.

My reason for saying this is that if there were enough action spaces for everybody then each player would basically be playing his own solitaire. Furthermore the limited number of action spaces forces players to think up alternate strategies, and this is in my opinion where the game is misunderstood.

Let's take a step back here: What's the game about? It's about running a vineyard. Given that, what would you think that you should be doing to win? Exactly: You should make and sell lots of wine. It's very easy to subconsciously go with this line of reasoning based on the theme (I did so myself initially), the problem is that it leads you to think that the winning strategy of the game focuses on producing lots of wine.

Why is this a problem you may ask? It's a problem because the game has multiple viable strategies and by overlooking this you turn a great game of adaptable strategies into an exercise in frustration. I view Viticulture as a game where you have to adapt to what the others do, what your position is in the start order and what cards you draw, and if you don’t do this you’ll either get crushed by those who play adaptively or get frustrated if everybody uses the same strategy as you do.

There’s another criticism of the game that I’ve seen a lot, which I also disagree with, and which may seem completely unrelated, but in my opinion often has the same cause as the “too few action spaces”-misconception. This criticism is that there’s too much luck in the draw of the visitor cards because most are too situational and if you don’t get one that fit your situation then you’re out of luck.

This critique is based on the premise that you have a fixed strategy and from that point of view it’s quite likely that the visitor cards you draw won’t be useful to you. This is exactly the same wrong premise that caused the too-few-action-spaces-misconception.

Instead of having one fixed strategy you need to adapt your strategy to the circumstances of the current game you’re playing and this includes the cards you’re dealt. So instead of thinking “this card doesn’t fit my strategy”, you must ask yourself “what should my strategy be so that I can benefit from this card?” That’s not to say you can’t draw cards that won’t be useful in any given game, that will happen, but it’ll happen a lot less if you’re having an adaptable strategy.

So my point is that I think that a lot of the criticism leveled at this game is based on a single misconception of the game. It’s not a game with a fixed long term strategy of producing lots of wine. Instead it’s a game of adaptable strategies.

That’s not to say that the game has no faults or that everybody will like the game. If for example you prefer building fixed long term strategies and trying to execute and perfect them, then you definitely won’t appreciate Viticulture as I do, and I’m not criticizing your preference. Preferring fixed or adaptable strategies is subjective, and my preference is not better than yours, but if you criticize the game for having too few action spaces or too situational visitor cards, then please consider your perception of the game: Do you perceive the game to have multiple viable strategies that you need to use adaptively or are you approaching the game from the point of view that it’s vital to produce a lot of wine. If you fall in the latter category (as I did initially), then I ask you to consider the game from an adaptable-strategy-with-multiple-paths-to-victory-perspective, otherwise you risk missing out on a game that a lot of BGGers find higly enjoyable.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for so eloquently summarizing what type of game Viticulture is. Like you, I prefer games that require me to "think on the fly." Also, you're so right about initially being focused on selling wine. I even explained the game that way the first time I played it. In the future, I'll explain the game in a way that players understand there are several ways to score points, and they need to be opportunistic in their strategy.

EDIT: This variant was previously suggested by Jeff Smith in this thread: http://boardgamegeek.com/article/12423487#12423487. I guess us Smiths think alike!

In Viticulture, the number of available spaces per action is as follows:
- 2 players: 1 space
- 3 or 4 players: 2 spaces
- 5 or 6 players: 3 spaces

At the start of the game, this leads to having a higher ratio of workers/spaces in 2/4/6-player games (0.5), than in 3/5-player games (0.375-0.42). Some people have said they think the availability of spaces in 2/4/6-player games is too tight, requiring a more cutthroat play style to get the spots you want. I personally don't have an issue with the game, having played mostly 2 and 6-player games so far. However, I did think of a small variant to loosen up the game:

With 2/4/6 players, use the Grande Worker from the expansion, and allow the Grande Worker to perform an action, even if all of the spaces for that action have been taken. When doing so, the bonus is NOT available.

I think this variant provides an interesting decision for the players: do I use the Grande Worker on an open action space to get the bonus, or do I use him to take an action that is otherwise blocked?

If you think the 2/4/6-player game is too tight and you try this variant, please let me know how it went. I think wake-up order and blocking are important components of the competitive nature of this game, so I didn't want to water them down too much by increasing the number of available spaces/action by one, for example. This variant helps players still get that one critical action they need, while providing another interesting decision. It also ensure players can fill a wine order on the final round, assuming they have the resources to do so.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How many workers can be built? Is there still a 6-worker cap or does the Grande open up the possibility for 7 workers, as in
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
?

I've noticed that additional workers seem to be more helpful in
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
than they are in the base game, so perhaps maintaining the 6-worker cap would be good.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I like this idea, it seems to go well with the idea of being able to use the grande worker in a 2-player game that enables it to use the bonus action. This provides another option of use for the grande worker and could really up the strategy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamey (the designer) ruled in another thread that, when using the Grande Worker in the base game, the maximum number of workers per player is still six.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, for the base game, the cap is 6 workers, including the grande worker.

I'd like to include a new worker in the expansion that lets you take an action even if it's full. Not sure what he'll be called yet, but I view him as a different worker than the grande.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ladrone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I also like the idea of giving this ability to the neutral worker that you can get with the 7 wake-up spot. No one ever takes the neutral worker since you don't usually need a lot of workers in this game, except when playing with the expansion. So having the neutral worker able to place on a full action spot makes the 7 spot a more viable choice than just going with the VP point at 6.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Call him

Renaissance Worker

After all, he can do anything!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My nephew loves the neutral worker. I also found it quite useful in creating my recent

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I agree. I listed several ways the bonus worker is better than the 1VP spot in this thread:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What a genius idea
http://boardgamegeek.com/article/12423487#12423487
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I had played a two player game with my brother a few weeks ago with this variant. We called it "the squeeze" since the grande was able to squeeze in. Ultimately it was only used maybe two times by each person throughout the game and mostly at the end. But on my last winter i had used it in conjunction with a winter visitor card to be able to fill two wine orders shooting me over the 20VP. At the end, I didn't know if I liked it because it allowed me to gain so many points in one go that my brother had no chance of scrambling in that winter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Doh! Sorry about re-posting your idea. I guess your idea stuck somewhere in the back of my head, but I forgot I had read it. I even re-read your other thread about trying several variants, to make sure I wasn't suggesting something that had already been posted.

Getting older sucks.

EDIT: I've given credit to you in my original post.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Señor Viticulturalist!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Or the blame, depending on what people think of the idea!

On a related note, my brother's name is Matt Smith. (get it, a related note...)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Sommelier.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That doesn't make thematic sense. How about "The Owner" or "The Boss". In Italian that would be "Il Capo", though that might remind Americans of gangsters.

I have ties to wineries, and believe me, if the boss wants something done, it gets done. Makes thematic sense...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If a location is full, then allow a player to place multiple workers on the location in order to take the action.

The first player to do this places two workers, the second to do this on the same location places three workers, etc.
No player may take a location's action more times than there are legal spaces for the action. For example, in a four player game there are two spaces available for each location. In this situation, no player could take an action more than two times in a year.
A grande worker paired with another worker, both played at the same time, would not entitle the player to the bonus.

Admittedly, I have not yet tried this variant. I will do so next time I play and report back with some thoughts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We played Phil's variant last week and it worked fine with 6 players. It was only used by players 4-5 times during game. Did not seem to unbalance anything.

We also used $10=1 VP at game end. I like this, otherwise money is useless.

Lastly we used the Grande worker. All in all a good game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oops, I forgot to report back. Sorry...

I played with my variant in 8 games, all with an even number of players. The choice of playing multiple workers was taken on average about 4 times a game, usually on the building space or on the order shipping space. Only once did anyone ever play 3 workers on a space, and this was done on the last turn of the game. While the games were all competitive, the winners for the most part never took advantage of this multiple worker placement. My opponents liked the variant.

I like my variant as well, as it reduces the frustration of not being able to take desired actions, and it gives players something to do with extra workers. However, I will probably never play with this variant again, as I prefer the new grande rule of being able to place him (her?) on an otherwise closed space. This official rules change is cleaner, more intuitive, and presents angst each turn of whether to use the grande early or save it for potential closed spaces in winter.

Now if only I can find blind playtesters for my expansion...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phil--Cool, I'm glad you like the new grande worker ability. Hopefully you get some blind playtesters so I can see what you create!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We played our first game ever with this variant (4 player game) and liked how it worked.

Is it a bad idea to use this variant with an odd number of players? Even with a little less competition for spaces it would seem that player order in that last round would be super crucial if no Grande Worker allowed to go on a full space. (this from the guy that has only played once )
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 988033:
The answer is probably very obvious or right in front of my eyes, but...I can't seem to find it anywhere in the rules:

When do you discard vine cards? I would think it's when you are harvesting the fields. But the rules specifically state (under harvesting fields & crushing grapes) "the vines stay planted on the field." 'Uprooting' only lets you take back a vine card into your hand, not discard it.

So, at what point in the process does a vine card ever get discarded?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The time I usually discard vines is when I have to discard down to 7 cards at the end of each year.

I also might do it in response to certain visitor cards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Huh? Interesting. So, how do you keep from confusing yourself when you want to 'harvest' a field that already has cards left over from a previous 'harvesting' action (since the vines stay on the field)?

Also, I forgot to mention - can you take the same action a second time with a second worker if its still available?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Gist:

Viticulture is a game about wine making. Players represent the owners of vineyards competing to make either the highest quantity, or the highest quality of wine. In either case, this translates into victory points. As soon as someone gets to 20 victory point, the game is over at the end of that round. The player with the most victory points wins.

N.B. The kickstarted version of this game comes with a small expansion, Arboriculture, which I won't touch on, since I have not yet played with it.

Gameplay

Spring

Viticulture plays out over a series of years, each of which is broken down into four distinct phases named for the four seasons. At the end of each year, there is a bookkeeping/cleanup phase after which the new year begins.

Every year starts in Spring, with the player possessing the first player token choosing both when his workers will "wake-up" for the year, and also which reward, tied to the wake-up order, they would like. Then, each other player in clockwise order follows suit.

Wake-up is the order in which players will place their workers for the rest of that year. It is therefore possible, indeed likely, that the person with the first player token will not be the first to place their workers. At the end of the year, the first player token passes counterclockwise.


Summer

Summer is the first worker placement phase. Each player starts the game with three workers, and any workers you place in summer will be unavailable during the Winter worker placement phase, so you will want to consider your actions carefully.

Starting with the player earliest in the wake-up order, players start placing their workers, immediately carrying out the corresponding action. Each player places one worker and only places a second when each other player has gone through the wake-up order. When a player either passes or runs out of workers, they may not place another worker in the current season.

The number of available spaces varies with the number of players...sort of. There is only one space per action in the two player game, two per action in the 3-4 player game, and 3 in the 5-6 player game. One of the spaces, unavailable in the two player game, offers a bonus to the player who uses it.

The following actions are available in the Summer:

Play a summer visitor card, or two with the bonus space. Summer visitors are represented by cards which let you do useful things.

Draw one vine card, two with the bonus space. These cards represent the vines which, once planted, will produce the grapes you will use to make wine.

Plant one vine, or two with the bonus space.

Give a vineyard tour to earn two money, three with the bonus space.

Sell grapes. If you are short of money but long on grapes, you can sell some. The bonus space gives you a victory point in addition.

Build a structure. There are many useful structures you can build in the game. The bonus space allows you to build for a lowered cost.

Autumn

In the Autumn, you merely draw either a summer or winter visitor card. This can be modified if you build the cottage, in which case you can draw two of these cards.

Winter

Winter is the other worker placement phase in which you place all of the workers you did not place in the Summer.

Wake-up order is still in effect, so that if you placed first in Summer, you will place first in Winter, even if you were the last player to place a worker in the Summer.

The following actions are available in the Winter:

Draw one wine order card, two with the bonus space. These cards represent orders that you fill with wine you have made, providing both victory points and monetary payments every year thereafter.

Play a winter visitor card, or two with the bonus space. Mechanically the same as Summer Visitor cards.

Hire extra worker. Pay a fee (lower with the bonus space), get another worker available to you in the following year up to a total of six.

Harvest Field. Harvest all of the vines in one of your three fields, two fields if you took the bonus action. This is how you get grapes.

Crush grapes. In many ways, the heart of the game. This space allows you to make wine from the grapes you've harvested. The bonus space lets you make better quality wine.

Fill a wine order, gaining an extra victory point with the bonus space. See above.

End of the Year:

After everyone has passed in Winter, the year end comes. Payments attached to wine orders are made from the bank, grapes and wine are aged, and the first player marker is passed to the person who got to choose their place in the wake-up order last in the turn just ending.

My thoughts.

The Good:

The components are of high quality, and are very nicely designed. The artwork is quite nice as well. Clearly, a lot of thought and attention were paid to the visual representation of the game.

I found the theme rather charming, and I think the designers did a good job of maintaining the illusion of vineyard operation, for the most part.

One of the designers has been very active here on BGG, answering questions always in a timely and friendly manner. I really applaud that kind of dedication to one's creations.

The Bad: As much as I wish it were not so, much of what I think about the gameplay is bad.

The game scales poorly, and plays far better with odd numbers of players. Going from three to four players, for example, adds three more workers (more later in the game), but no more spaces to take actions. We found this to be far too constraining. Some actions, such as building, are far too important, especially in light of the fact that the vine all players start the game with requires you to take a building action before you can even plant it.

In my opinion, worker placement games should scale both to the number of players and to the relative importance of certain actions. My group found the game unplayable with an even number of players, and twice just stopped playing in the middle of a game.

Money is very tight at the beginning of a game, which is just fine. However, as you go through, it becomes painfully clear that there is little use for money later on, and so it piles up. While it is used as an end-game tiebreaker, in-game it quickly becomes a little used resource.

The actions themselves are a problem. Some are just better than others in most situations, exacerbating the scaling problem. There are few years in which you will not want to build something, and almost no years in which you will ever want to take the sell grapes action.

There is no penalty for increasing your worker count. Apparently, workers in 19th century Tuscany do not require payment. This is the single most puzzling design decision I find in the game. Requiring players to pay their workers would at once make money far more valuable, and relieve the choke-point at the build action space.

The Summer and Winter Visitor cards just make the game too volatile. Some are much too good, and others are either too situational or just plain awful. This introduces an unacceptable (at least to me) amount of luck in a game of this type.

Conclusion

Viticulture is a game I very much wanted to like, but ultimately I don't think it's very good. The physical beauty of the game in no way makes up for the poor play.

There are simply far superior worker placement games out there, and while I greatly appreciate the effort designer Jamey Stegmaier has taken to address issues with the game, I just wouldn't recommend Viticulture.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very good review. Do you mind saying how many times you played the game?

Also, I've rarely failed to finish a game; this has usually indicated a game with SERIOUS problems. Was it that bad, or is it possible that group-think was leading you to misinterpret the game in some way?

the rulebook says:

Note: The first player to act in the summer, fall and winter reverts back to the wake-up chart order from the spring of that year. Thus, in the example, above, even if Player 2 (level 4 on the wake-up chart) is the last player to act in the summer, he will be the first player to act in the fall, and then again in the winter.

How can Player 2 act last in the summer when he is in front of player 1 in the wake-up chart? He will always act first, in each of the seasons. At least thats my understanding from the explanation of the seasons on page 3.

Please clarify
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player 1 decided to save workers for the Winter, but Player 2 still wanted to play 1 more.

Example (P2 is first to wakeup and has 4 workers, P1 has 3 workers):

-SUMMER-
P2 places worker
P1 places worker
P2 places worker
P1 Passes
P2 places worker
-FALL-
P2 draws
P1 draws
-WINTER-
P2 places last worker
P1 places worker
P1 places last worker.

* So you can see P2 was last to play in Summer, and still first in Fall/Winter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marc--What it means is that if Player 2 places a worker in the summer after Player 1 has finished placing workers for the season, instead of Player 1 going next in the fall or winter, Player 2 is still the first player to act in those seasons. Basically, just follow the order on the wake-up track every season.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
thank you both a lot for the quick reply, that makes sense what you say, sorry for my misunderstanding. I will play my 1st game of Viticulture on Thursday (I just want to be prepared for it as good as possible)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marc--I appreciate the preparation! If you're playing with other people who don't know the rules, it might be helpful for them to watch the top 2 videos here (http://www.stonemaiergames.com/videos/) to get a general idea of how the game works in advance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I will watch the videos and I will be the one who teaches the rules - I'm through the rulebook (and FAQ) now, and there are no more open questions for me right now.

The rulebook is very good and explains everything you need to know in detail, I'm very satisfied with it. The turn order was the only thing that I didn't get immediately (but its more my fault than the rulebooks, cause I apparently didn't read that section careful enough)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Marc! I should take some blame, though--the best rulebooks don't need an FAQ.

Last night my wife and I played a quick 2p game to prime us for
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
, and I tested some ideas I've had about the game to good effect.

First, we checked the score book to see who got the grapes first. I'd lost our previous game (on May 28th) 21–4, so I definitely got the first move. I set my alarm for 2 o'clock and drew a vine. She chose to sleep in till 3 and drew an order.

I decided to go for the Pinot Opening: build a trellis and plant your starting vine in the summer, then harvest your grapes in the winter. My wife built up her workforce.

A thought I'd had floating around in my head was that summer visitor cards tend to be more useful in the early game while winter visitor cards tend to help more in the late game. I don't know if that's true; I'd have to evaluate each card and count some stats. But it was a vague feeling I'd had and I wanted to test it. So in the first fall, I drew a second summer visitor instead of evening my hand by drawing a winter visitor.

I drew luck: a Handyman friend of mine contacted me about a desire to visit my growing vineyard some summer and we made arrangements for a visit sometime after I'd built a medium cellar.

The next spring, my wife set her work schedule for a 2 o'clock start that year and not wanting to pass up bonuses to beat her to the vines, I decided to take on an intern for the year.

I sent my intern out to lead a vineyard tour right out of the gate while my wife built a trellis and did some planting. In the winter, my wife rushed to use a professor to build her workforce some more, leaving the harvesting open to me. After doubling the number of grapes on my crush pad while hers lay empty, I made contacts with potential wine buyers while she continued to expand her workforce. She ended up with six workers by the end of the second year.

In the third year, I got up earlier and built a medium cellar. My wife passed early in the summer, giving me a chance to get some good work done. I got in touch with that Handyman friend and had him convert my trellis into a large cellar. Keep in my mind that I still had just the original pinot vine planted.

Now, with still just three workers and one planted pinot, but a lot of grapes and a great big cellar, I started contacting potential wine buyers in earnest. I built a yoke fairly early to guarantee steady harvesting ability, and I took on a few more interns over the years, but I never trained another permanent worker or built any irrigation system (though I did plant one more vine in that first field, a trebbiano, which required rebuilding my trellis).

I harvested each year, crushed sparingly and wisely, and filled four wine orders fairly quickly: one for a high-end white and a sparkling; one for a typical white and a sparkling; one for a high-end white; one for a mid-grade red and a mid-grade blush. I knew what I'd be crushing grapes into long before anyone took off her shoes, so I was able to make the exact wines needed with mostly just the pinot grapes I started with (though I did eventually need a superior white harvest to speed up some of my later orders).

I finished the game with 21 VPs, ₤2, 3 workers, 2 vines, one bunch of grapes on my crush pad, and an empty cellar.

While I was putting together the wines for my last order, my wife was able to sneak in her first two wine orders (in one season), preventing a shutout with an eleven-point surge. But she had lots of grapes, lots of wines, lots of lire, and lots of workers. If the game had gone longer, her vineyard would easily have surpassed mine. But I'd established a reputation by then that no level of output from my competitor could overshadow.

Obviously I got lucky with the cards. But now I've shown myself that you really can win the game with a very small productive capacity if you use it as economically as possible.

I like the way you wrote this, WDP, as if the visitors are people you know and are stopping by to help you now and then. Great writeup!

Any suggestions?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keep an eye in the Euphoria KS? There are some pledge levels which include the retail version of Viticulture as an additional reward. They are all filled up, but Jamey is supposed to add some more levels in the middle of this week which include the Kickstarter edition of Viticulture, with a few more goodies. You might be able to snatch one of those limited levels when they open up, or snipe one of the "retail" levels if somebody updates his pledge to the KS edition.

http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jameystegmaier/euphoria-...

Alternatively, Jamey has mentioned in the comments to the Euphoria KS that the retail copies of Viticulture should be on their way to regular stores now, so you might be lucky enough to buy a copy from a regular store. I don't know how many might have found their way to this side of the Atlantic Ocean, though.

Cheers!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I ordered few copies for my friends and seems like I might have one extra for sale. It's the full Kickstarter version with the Arboriculture expansion. So if anyone's interested drop me a geekmail and I'll put one for sale on the BGG marketplace.

Hilo ID 986001:
Has anyone used the set of stickers provided in the Kickstarter version? Are you supposed to use the stickers to modify the numbers on existing cards?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm glad you started this thread. I'd like to hear the most creative ideas, or if people are using the stickers at all.

The stickers can be used to modify the cards, back of board, or the player mats, but it's the player mats where I see the most potential. Different player mats could have different costs for the structures, and you could shuffle and deal them at the beginning of the game like in 7 Wonders.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think this is how I will eventually use them but right now I and still teaching those around me and building strategies without throwing in curveballs.

What I would want would be personalities with each modified card. Jamey, if you were a Vineyard owner and you had a card, what would it look like (how would you modify to your personality?)

I have two chances to introduce Viticulture to my family and friends this weekend. I had a great time playing the game with my younger brother and sister on Friday.

A bigger success, however, was when I introduced the game to my friends from my university years on Saturday. We played games infrequently, mostly because most of them are quite busy working, and can’t get together as much as we like. So I really only played light or medium weight game with them most of the time. Here’s the list of game we play on Saturday: Love Letter, Eselsbrücke, Munchkins, Forbidden Island, and Viticulture.

I’ll admit, even though I have played several 4p game of Viticulture already, some of the concern in the forums about 4p being too tight and frustrating, made me decided to bring out the game only after one of the player left, and we are down to three players. Beside me, there’s a male and a female player. The dude, let’s call him Denny, is the more experienced one, who also played board games with his friends. The girl, let’s call her Joyce, only ever played games with us, but she can handle strategy game just fine most of the time.

After a few introductory games, I decided to play my fullest in this game, particularly because I haven’t win that much. Denny decided to go with an early cottage strategy, after I stress how powerful the visitor cards can be. Joyce, on the other hand, was really struggling throughout the game. I took the lead with a few small orders in the beginning, but Denny leaped over me with the help of visitor cards and wine order, and stayed in the lead. I made a critical mistake in the penultimate year, and waste several of my workers doing less then effective moves. Another factor in my downfall is the ineffective planning in planting vines. The game ended in Year 7, when Denny finished another big order and scored 23. I lagged behind at 14, and Joyce only made it to 8.

However, surprisingly, Joyce was the one who is most enamored with the game. Or not surprising, because right around year 5, when her score is still in -1, I recalled she turning her head to me and whispered: “I think I get the charm of this game”. She then played a few visitor cards to bring her score up. Post-game, Joyce asked me if there’s computer program of Viticulture, which I reply, no. She told me the only other time she likes a game so much is "Settler of Catan", which after she played it, she brought the digital version and proceeded to obsessively playing it.

She even called me the next day, during Sunday Church, and asked if we are planning to meet up again soon, and also ask me to acquire a copy for her. I never got a phone call from her, and it really shows how much she likes it.

Thank you Jamey, for providing my friends and family with such a great game!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James--Would you consider being an ambassador for Viticulture. You seem to really "get" it, and people who play with you enjoy the experience. It's a program I'm going to start up after Euphoria. If you're interested, e-mail me at stonemaiergames@gmail.com.

Thanks!

Last week my brother and I spent a vacation with our families at our mother's house. We played a number of games,
War of the Ring
The New Science
Great Heartland Hauling Co.
Eight Minute Empire
Legacy
Dominion
Fleet

And finally Viticulture. My brother, mother and I have played this game before. During the Kickstarter campaign I made a PnP version and reviewed it here on BGG. This week though, was our first game with a final copy and Arboriculture.
During the first game I cheated. No no no, wait, I did it for a good cause. I wanted my mother to get the visitor card that I had sponsored and had me and my son on it, The Professor in the winter visitor card deck. It was so much fun as she got the card and read the text. She looked up at the board, thinking of her next move and then returned to the card and smiled. What a fun moment. That first game was about relearning but despite my brother and I being avid gamers my mother was able to keep her own and the score were close in the end.
The next two games were my brother and I, and it is from these games that I wanted to write about. After the first game with me winning, still a close game, my brother did something that he doesn't normally do. He immediately started setting up the board and told me, "again". Let me stress this, my brother wanted to play another hour long game after playing War of the Ring and the previous session of Viticulture right in a row. IT WAS 2:00AM!
Viticulture has subtle hints of strategy that become more apparent with more play throughs, but doesn't let you stick with it always. The cards and your opponents strategy will alway make you stay on your toes. The second game if the night I was behind something like 4 to 11 or so, mainly due to not keeping my morale high enough due to not having extra workers. My brother had gotten a apple tree planted and the yoke so he was able to harvest each year. Though I was admitting defeat in my head I also was holding my cards and waiting for the perfect moment. 3-4 wine orders filled and I had gotten 23 points. My brother was able to scrape together 22 points and a few curses towards me.

After a few days of being home from vacation I emailed him and asked him to list his favorite games. He listed War if the Ring first (which I agreed) and the Viticulture next. This was interesting because The New Science (an excellent game) was his copy and he has a PhD in sciency stuff, and he still picked Viticulture. I will leave you with the quote from his email.

"Viticulture-kept wanting another shot to improve.
New Science-good but not as deep as Viti."

Thank you for you time.

This weekend, I have two chances to introduce Viticulture to my family and friends. Viticulture has become my favorite game so far, and I have played it at least once every week since getting the game.

Late last Friday, when my younger sister finally got home from school, my younger brother enthusiastically called from a game night with the three of us. I own the games, but he’s the one who always like to gather us to play. They are light-to-medium weight players, mostly because I am a light-to-medium player myself, so I really haven’t played heavier game with them. It’s mostly Ticket to Ride, “Survive!”, or Finca. The heaviest one is Notre Dame, only because it is my favorite and I made them play .

Anyway, when I pulled out the Viticulture box, they were both amazed at the box sleeve and even more amazed when I took out all the components. The theme of wine making also intrigued them. After we picked our color pieces, my sister commented that the worker-eeple looks just like Master Yoda, which is ironic because I’m the biggest SW fan in the room, and my brother the second, and we didn’t notice it before. To be fair, she always picks green, and that’s why she saw Yoda immediately.

It’s a 3p game, with big worker. I taught the game in a little less than 20 minutes. I tried a different approach in that I taught the order backward. I told them we score by filling order with wine, and make wine with grapes, and harvest grapes through vines, and plant vines in the summer. They don’t ask a lot of question during the explanation, but I think they got most of the gist.

The game went on to proceed nicely. I decided to try alternative route to victory, so I leaved most of the vital spot for wine making to my bro and sis. They struggled a bit in the beginning, sometimes unable to distinguish between harvests and crushing grapes, but my bro manage to train up to 5 workers, and managed to sell a lot of grapes for money and victory points. My sister goes the more traditional making wine and filling order path. And I used windmill and tasting room to earn some much need victory points, only make wine when there’s spare worker.

In Year 10, both my bro and I were hovering close to the finish line, but my sister surprised us by filling a big order with three wines, and dashed to the 20 point before any one of us could. She has only three workers throughout the game, and I thought she was struggling, but she got some nice boost from a couple of visitor cards, and managed to pull a win over both her older siblings.

They enjoyed the game overall, and while both of them took some time to get their vineyard going, once they did, it's become very smooth and second nature to them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's great to see how this game can be played by all of the family, not just the gamers. My session report she be approved soon and it has alot of the same tones because I played with my brother and mom. Such a fun game!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks James! I'm really intrigued by your method of teaching it backwards. That's actually quite clever.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I usually teach the game in the order of seasons: from Spring to Winter. I found that players would forget about the next step in wine-making because they have to remember other stuff in between. When I started from the goal of filling orders, and moved backward before I introduced all the action that you take in summer and winter, I think the players have a better picture on the wine-making process: plant, harvest, crush, and fill order. I'll try teaching in this way more, and see how it goes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James - Have you utilized the backwards order approach while teaching Viticulture to any new players since your last post? I will likely have opportunities over the next month or two to teach the game to several new players. I think teaching it backwards sounds like a good idea, and was wondering if you have any additional feedback on your experiences.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Devin,

I only taught the game backwardly twice, including this time, and both of them appeared to proceed fine. But unfortunately I didn't have more chance to teach the game that way after the first month or so. Most of it it's because I'm playing with veteran. So I don't have any more insight into that.

I think it's important to let the player understand the one thing they had expected to accomplish: making wine. I think once they have a concrete concept of how you can do that, they would have a much better time playing the game.

Hope you have a good time teaching the game, it's marvelous fun
I hope you have a nice gaming day with Viticulture
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the quick response and for the well wishes. Cheers!

My 9-year-old son is a self-professed board game hater. Yes, this crushes my game-loving heart. In reality, he hates to lose, and gets very anxious when he thinks he's losing, so he refuses to play competitive games. My wife and I have only been able to get him to play some co-op games with us, and only sparingly.

This morning I had Viticulture set up on the table, and had just started a solo 2-player game to see how the Arboriculture expansion works. My son had seen the game before, and knew it was about making and selling wine. When I explained the expansion involved apples, tomatoes, and olives, he got interested. He loves gardening, and has a nice vegetable garden that he tends (with my wife's help).

He wanted me to play Minecraft with him, and I told him I would in a few minutes, after I played a couple of rounds of Viticulture. He came back into the room right as I finished the first round, and asked if he could play the game with me. I was shocked! But I played it cool and said, "Sure". I let him take over one of the players. We played with face-up cards, so I could explain the game as we went. I also helped him with his strategy for the first few rounds, so he could see how to plan his actions for each year.

He caught on very quickly. I didn't try to explain everything up front, but instead focused on helping him plan what he wanted to do each round. I tried to play my own game, even though I knew what he planned to do. After a few rounds, he told me he didn't need any more help, and could figure out his turns by himself. He struggled a bit with the crush grapes action, but otherwise had a really good grasp on the game.

He was well ahead of me on the VP track for most of the game. However, I eventually started to catch up, due to having one more worker than him, and having access to olives. I also drew a summer visitor card that allowed me to uproot a vine and score VPs equal to the grape value of the card. This was a lucky draw for me, as I had a 4-grape card in one of my fields. These 4 points allowed me to draw even with my son. He was not happy that I was in position to possibly win. However, he had a 6-VP wine order card that he was trying to complete. He also had three visitor cards that awarded VPs, but he really wanted to complete that wine order.

It was tight on the final round, but I couldn't block him out of completing his wine order because he has a winter visitor that allowed him to complete a wine order. My best play was to play a winter visitor first, as it allowed me to both crush grapes and complete an order. My son then crushed grapes to get the white wine he needed to fill his wine order (he already had the sparkling wine in his cellar). Since I didn't have enough wine left to fill another order, I couldn't take the fill wine order action to block him, so he took the action with his Grande Worker and scored seven points, which gave him a total of 20 points. The final score was 20-17.

I give high marks to Viticulture. The theme enticed my son to finally play a competitive eurogame with me. The game was easy enough for him to understand, yet challenged his strategic thinking. I was impressed by how he quickly caught on to planning all of his actions for a round, then re-planning when he was blocked from an action. After the game, he went to my wife and said she needed to learn the game, so we could all play it together. My wife and I both thought this was a good step forward for our son. It's good for kids to learn how to compete fairly, and both win and lose gracefully. Maybe he'll become a gamer yet!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great write-up! I've got 2 girls and hope when they get old enough they want to sit down and play a game with the wife and I.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great write up!
I just introduce this game to my young bro and sis, both of them in their 20s. They enjoyed it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This thread makes me extremely happy. Thank you for sharing that, Matt. Really--this made my night.

Is it legal to play the middle action space to sell grapes, which gives 1 bonus VP, even if you have 0 grapes to sell? The rules for this action space says "sell any number of grapes" which "any" indicates 0 grapes too. However the game rule says you cannot block other players just for the sake.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wouldn't think so, as in this game, you are not allowed to take null actions - you may only take a space or play a card if you are actually able to perform the action.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can't sell zero grapes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page four of the rule book specifically forbids this. You cannot take any action space if you cannot perform the action.

If you have no grapes to sell, you cannot take the sell grapes action.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some of the variants we stumbled upon to where we think are now part of our base games.

1) The extra worker (7th wakeup spot) can be placed ANYWHERE regardless if there is a space (but the extra worker cannot get a bonus).
The extra worker at the 7th wakeup spot seemed really undervalued. With the above rule, the extra worker fits more inline with being worth more than a VP which resides above it in the wake-up track. We played this a few times and it worked and made sense.
I think this is now a rule/function that is integrated into ALL of our games. It really adds to the strategy in that possible "last round".

2) Use the grande workers in the base game.
Basically replace one of your 3 starting workers with the grande worker of your color. This speeds up a 2 player game and makes things interesting. I think this works best in a 2 player game. But can help speed up any game. If you want a tighter base game don't use the grande workers as part of the base game.

3) Cutthroat version
You can block. Regardless if you can do the action or not you can place a player in any available space. I think this is more for the experienced players, but we found this allows the "train a worker" to be much more effective as people have often won the game without ever going above their 3 workers.


What didn't work:
A) Paying for placing in extra slots
Tried it out where you had to pay your difference in residual income to the last player (N^1 - N^2) + 2 Lira to be able to place a worker in an extra slot. It was just easier to do the extra worker variant in #1. This may be a solid way to balance out funds...but saying the extra worker can do this is much more fun.

B) In the Summer/Winter play areas you can choose to either play the card or pick up a card.
This detracted from playing the wakeup slot for take a summer or winter visitor card. And made the game too card farm-y like Loyang and not situational like Agricola.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for trying out all these variants and posting the results. I like #1 where the neutral worker can be placed anywhere, even if the place is full. I do agree that the extra worker isn't as valuable as the VP considering this game doesn't really need you to have a lot of workers.

And I agree, the Grande Worker is a must for 2 player games, and very beneficial in any number of player games.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for posting these! What do you think about Sky Zero's variant that allows all players to spend lira for victory points at the end of the final year (after residual payments) at a rate of $5:1 VP?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think some people are undervaluing the bonus worker. He's being negatively compared to the 1 VP space. Let's take a look at some things you could do with that extra worker, instead of taking the 1 VP spot:
1. Fill another wine order (3+ VPs, and 1+ RI).
2. Harvest another field (which typically yields enough grapes to fill a wine order once the grapes/wine age). This is a very safe option if you have already built the Yoke.
3. Crush grapes to create another type of wine (sets you up to fill a more complex/high-value wine order sooner).
4. Assuming you have the Windmill, you can plant a vine and get 1 VP plus more options/better grapes when harvesting.
5. Assuming you have the tasting room, you can give a tour and get 1 VP plus 2-3 Lira.
6. Play another visitor card, which often yields more that 1 VP.

Obviously most of these are situational, but I think they illustrate there are several times during the game when you'd be better off taking the extra worker than the 1 VP. It's the classic choice between safe but restricted gain (1 VP), and less safe but possibly much better gain (extra worker). Players new to a game almost always think the safe option is better, until they really explore the game and learn how to take advantage of the less-safe option.

Also, selecting either position 6 or 7 on the wake-up track usually means you're going last, so you're not sacrificing turn order to get the extra worker instead of the 1 VP.

In summary, there are times the extra worker is going to yield much more than 1 VP, so giving him more powers isn't necessary. It's not like each wake-up track bonus is always supposed to be better than those at earlier positions. For example, if you already have a lot of grapes/wine, you may value a wine order card much more than 1 VP. If you have open field space and the windmill, the +1 vine card is worth more to you than the 1 VP space, because you'll be earlier in the turn order (yes you have to take an action to plant the vine, but you probably have extra workers by that time anyway).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's well said, Matt. You know the game well already!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I often go for the extra worker instead of the victory point. But like just about everything in this game, it's all situational.

However, allowing the extra worker to be placed on a filled action seems like it would mess with the turn order dynamic too much. I mean, if I know I can definitely take a needed action and get an extra action as well, why would I ever NOT want to go last? I could use my other workers to snatch spaces from other players and finish with any action I choose.

But I haven't tried it yet, so I may be rushing to judgment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Jamey,
Played a few more 5-6 player games testing the variant and everyone agreed that they prefer the game with a Lira to VP trade-in to incentivize end game, but they all felt $5:1 was a little to swingy. It works great at 2-player because games move quicker and end sooner, but with more players, games play out longer over more rounds giving opportunity to hoard money. We've since played 2 games at $10:1 which is far more restrictive, but also not nearly as swingy. I've updated the variant and will continue to test. Something tells me the right balance is actually 8:1, but I want to play more games at 10:1 and get more feedback before making any additional changes to the variant. Good thing my wife and friends enjoy the game! .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keep me in the loop about what you find. Thank you so much for sharing Viticulture with others!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a two player game the extra worker isn't worth as much as the VP spot...hell he isn't worth anything. In a two player game the earliest player always chose the plant action. The game was WAY longer than 45 - 90 minutes as only random vine was getting planted per turn unless you got a card that let you plant another vine. The grey worker was chosen one time and after the round we looked over the board and he should have picked up the 1 VP.

We both looked at each other and said man the plant vine action is way to rare in a two player game. I think we will use the grey worker going to the extra spot next time we play. It was a fun game once we got into the swing. We also questioned the starting card needing the trellis. I read the other posts about that and am still at odds about it. We will try the Grey worker variant for now and then maybe see about switching out the starting pinot but one thing at a time.

Well after reviewing the FAQ (Which I like to do before I try a variant lol) we made one MAJOR mistake that made the game take almost 2 hours and seem like the plant vine action was mandatory for the first action each round. We uprooted the fields after a harvest. Doh! We couldn't figure out why there was an uproot action. When we finished we both were like man we had to be doing something wrong lol. Well I am looking to retry this later this week and maybe reread the rules a few times between now and then.

Glad to see a FAQ
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yep, that's my go-to thought when I hear that the game is taking too long and that there are issues with the harvest. Just like on a real vineyard, you don't uproot your vines every summer. You just pluck grapes off of them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, I got to play this finally over the long weekend and had a blast but after reading a bit more i realized we made one large mistake.

We allowed each player to place all their tokens for each season at once rather than take turns. This made it so the people always chose first awake every time.

Also, for the life of me, I can't figure out why someone would want to uproot a vine. Can anyone explain it to me? Can't you just keep adding vines to fields to make the field more productive?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nick--It is rare that you'd want to uproot a vine. The maximum value of each field is 6, so halfway through the game you might realize that you made an ill-advised plant early on and want to change it. So you could uproot the vine and move it to a better field.

You are correct that each player may only place one worker at a time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This thread is very valuable.
I've been playing solo with the Tuscany Autobot and the Mommas&Poppas,
but I'd like to play solo w/Autobot and no module:

Should I just add an extra turn (7+1=8) to reflect no module?
(I'm trying to practice in tournament conditions that
would only be using the base Viticulture.)

Anyone in Canada seen their copy yet?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Norm--Did you get the e-mail I sent to all Canadian backers a few days ago? This is what it said:

Viticulture backers in Canada,


I just wanted to write to thank you for your patience and explain why it's taking so long to get the games to you. Your games shipped from China to New York with the the US games, and they were sent to Amazon.com with the US games. From there, Amazon sent your games via freight trucking to a warehouse in Illinois. That truck takes about 10 days, and thus it should arrive later this week. That warehouse will then pallet the games and send them to Amazon.ca, which should only take a few days if we don't have any customs issues.


Amazon will process the games (1 day) and notify me that they are ready for shipping, and then I can upload your addresses. A day or two later, Amazon will send the games to you, and you should will get shipment notification e-mails with tracking numbers.


Obviously this isn't an efficient system, so with Euphoria I'm sending the games directly to Canada from China to eliminate the 3 middle men. But for now, I can assure you that the games are on the way and that you'll get an e-mail from Amazon (or a delivery service) when your games are sent to you from Amazon.ca. The one nice part is you don't have to pay customs since we're paying them when the games cross the border.


Thanks!
Jamey
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ah, that explains it.

No I didn't get this but unfortunately I'm not a backer, I missed the kickstarter, but fortunately my FLGS did back it so I'm getting one from them. I was just wondering on a timeline as I hadn't seen anything from any of the Canadian backers.

Thanks much for the info Jayme,

p.s. Can't wait for Euphoria, looks awesome...I caught that one in time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Norm! Hopefully it'll be next week. I appreciate your support on Euphoria (and your interest in Viticulture).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamey, do you have any idea when the game will reach the retail shops in Canada? My wife and I are getting anxious to play
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. H. If your local shop ordered through Kickstarter, their games are on the way. If they ordered through traditional distribution, they should be in stores next week. You might want to call your store to make sure they're stocking it, though. Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Jamey. I have no idea which one they ordered, but I already have an order against it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My KS copy of Viticulture arrived to me in Canada last week, picked it up at UPS store on Friday. Can't wait for game night!

I'll have my copy of Viticulture with me at Origins. I'll be there Thursday-Sunday. I plan to spend a good deal of time in the Board Room playing games, so if you want to play Viticulture, geekmail me and we'll figure it out.

I'm sure they'll be other people there with their copy, but I wanted to let folks know in case they're interested in trying the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm definitely interested! GM sent your way.

It seems we should have a central list or something for people to coordinate and schedule games. Is there anything like that?

Date: May 25, 2013
Location: ROBA, Rochester Hills, MI, USA
Players (in 1st-turn selection order): John, Heath, Jim, Matt (me), Dan, Susan

I had received my Kickstarter copy of Viticulture only four days prior, and was excited to get it to the table at my monthly board game group. Four of us sat down to play and I started to explain the rules, when Dan and his sister Susan arrived. Dan is a close gaming buddy of mine, so I suggested they join the game. I knew six players, with five newbies, would make for a long game. However, several players were experienced gamers, so I hoped the game would not drag too much.

After a 15-20 minute explanation, we got started. We decided to use the Grande Worker from the Arboriculture expansion, as suggested by Jamey and others on this site. I had emphasized the importance of the cards, so the first few players took the bonus card spots on the wake-up track. My starting Summer visitor card was the card which gave me money for VPs. I thought it would be good to start with a lot of money, so I took the +1 VP wake-up spot to partially offset the 3 VPs I planned to spend on the first round.

Players pursued different early-game strategies, partially driven by the tight competition for certain actions. It seemed everyone wanted to build a structure early, but not everyone built the trellace. Dan built a cottage, to get two visitors each Fall. I built my medium cellar, because I had a visitor card (Craftsman?) which allowed me to exchange one structure for another. I used him to turn my trellace into my large cellar (a savings of $4). I did this because I had wine order cards which required wine that could only be stored in a large cellar.

Some of the players trained a new worker ASAP, because they had played other worker placement games and assumed getting more workers early was always better. They quickly found out you don't gain an advantage in 6-player Viticulture by rushing to increase your workforce. We found out that, in a typical round, there are only certain actions which you want to do/can do. We realized you need to grab an early spot on the wake-up track when there are specific actions you must do on a round to advance your position. Conversely, if your current game position allows for more flexibility in which actions you can perform in the current round, then you can take a later spot on the wake-up track and get a better bonus.

Players had a few questions during play, mostly around how to crush gapes into wine. The concept of selecting one TYPE of wine, then making as much of that TYPE of wine as you want, was difficult to grasp for some. Also, some of the visitor cards generated questions. However, overall the game played out smoothly.

One player suffered from AP, which this game can induce. If you play with AP-prone players, I highly recommend you start with a 3- or 4-player game. However, as the game progressed, the rounds started to happen more quickly. The new players were clearly getting the flow of the game, and were better prepared to take their action on their turn.

On what turned out to be the final round of the game, Jim played the Wedding Party card, which netted him 5 VPs, putting him at 19 VPs. I thought for sure he would follow this up with a wine order, so I played a wine order for 5 (4+1) VPs, putting me at 19 VPs too. Then Dan played a wine order worth 6 points (5+1), which put him at 21 VPs. We determined no one could catch him, so we quickly completed the round and tallied the final standings:

Dan: 21
Jim: 19
Matt: 19
Heath: 14
John: 12
Susan: 11

Play time was 2:15. Considering all of the distractions of playing in a room full of gamers, some AP downtime, and 5 new players, I thought it was a very reasonable length. Some players felt there was too much downtime, which is natural with so many new players. Everyone liked the Grande Worker.

I was very impressed at how the top three players pursued different early-game strategies, yet ended up within two points of each other at the end of the game. I went for early money and high-value wines, and didn't get more workers until mid-game. Jim went for early workers, then built up money for the Wedding Party and (IIRC) the tasting room. Dan built an early cottage, then a windmill, then started filling wine orders later. Dan always had a ton of cards, sometimes having to discard down to seven. However, he seemed to be able to make good combos by having so many cards to choose from, which seems like a good early-game strategy.

Viticulture is not multi-player solitaire. You really have to pay attention to what the other players are doing, and try to predict what actions they want to execute each round. If you think you'll get blocked out of an action you really need to perform, then you'll want to take an early wake-up spot. For example, in one round I took spot #1 on the wake-up track, then immediately passed in the Summer phase. A couple of players said, "Why did you go first, only to pass?" I replied that I needed to ensure I could perform certain Winter actions. I really needed to harvest two fields, crush and fill a wine order, if possible. I could see several other players were in a position to harvest/crush, which is why I went first.

I'm looking forward to many more plays of Viticulture. It's a game that is pretty easy to learn/teach, but challenging to play.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an awesome writeup! Thanks for taking the time to write this and to teach the game to so many new players. That's a daunting task for any game.

Specifically it is a "Pinot" vine card, right?

Does it start already planted in a field or just in hand? I ask, because then you'd have to build a trellis straight off.

Cameron
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It starts in your hand. Yes, you have to build a trellis before you can plant it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wonder why the designers chose to start the game this way. It seems to me that having players start with a vine planted, one which requires neither irrigation nor a trellis, and a random vine in one's starting hand, might obviate the rote opening move of building the trellis.

I have only played once, and I assume the designers play tested various opening setups. Nonetheless, I may try this and see how it works out.

I was very much looking forward to getting together with friends and introducing them to Viticulture. We met up with another couple and while I was a little nervous about playing a 4 player game due to reports that the 4 player game was not much fun, I was hoping that the Grande Worker would balance it out enough. Was I right? Sadly, no, it was not enough.

While the game started out fine and everyone was enjoying the game for the first several years, the number of muttered curses when someone couldn’t do an action increased steadily. The good news is that everyone scored victory points. The bad news is that it was highly dependent upon the randomness of the cards and restricted by the limited action spaces.

For example, my husband struggled the whole game as most of the cards he drew did not work together. It wasn’t until the later half of the game that he surged forward.

One friend was able to steadily move forward the whole game because she built the wine tasting room early and also had some great visitor card combos when she was able to play 2 at a time.

Our other friend surged forward quickly at the beginning, but he stalled out for the rest of the game and never earned any more points.

I leap-frogged off and on the whole game, but did managed to pull ahead at the end from 18 points to 23. Sadly, in that last year (8th year), only one other person was able to earn victory points. So the end score was me at 23, my husband at 18, our female friend at 16 and our male friend at 11.

Even though I won, it didn’t feel very good because at the end, when many of us still had workers, we stared at the board realizing there was nothing left to do that would earn any victory points. There was no point in finishing the year as the game was over. It just wasn’t satisfying.

So we talked about it for a while. I brought up the variant where all the spaces are completely open, but someone pointed out that would just be playing a multi-player solitaire game and there might as well not be turns. So we all agreed that even though it made no logical sense to be restricted, there had to be competition to make the game work as it is. So we talked about how a 2 and 3 player game felt fine and realized that it might work better to have the number of open spaces be equal to one less than the number of players. So with a 4 player game, 3 spaces would be open. In a 5 player game, 4 spaces would be open and a 6 player game would have 5 open spaces.

While I’d be willing to try that and maybe mix in the variant someone came up with for exchanging lira at the end of the game for victory points (5 lira for 1 VP), I really think the sweet spot for this game is 2-3 people. More players also add more time to the game and it’s already hard to get to the 60 minute goal with 2 or 3 players.

So I believe this will be a lot like Agricola for us, a game we only play with us. However, we still want to play with the expansion a little to see if we can find a balance where it adds enough to the game without adding the broken path to victory (where thematically you do not make the best vineyard, but make your workers the happiest people on earth). Maybe if we can tweak it enough, it’ll be a viable way to play with more people.

Do I still like Viticulture? Yes, very much! I really like the theme and most of the mechanics. It just could have used a little bit more play-testing before going out the door. But thankfully, BGG is a vibrant community where lots of people post variants to games all the time. Hopefully some of them will combine to make the game more enjoyable for larger groups of players.

Oh and as for the randomness of the cards, I think the issue there is that the cards are all very situation specific and if you keep getting cards that do not fit your situation then you’re just out of luck. It may mean the cards need more balancing, but I don’t know. I think the main issue is the action spaces. Once that is resolved and maybe having a few more ways to earn VPs, then the randomness of the cards is not a limiting factor and is just contributing to the replayability of the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interesting because the number of action spots per player is the same for 2 & 4 player (12 spots in 2 player, 24 spots in 4 player). In 4 player, you even have all the bonus spaces so I'd think that'd even help people get more done. (Only played 2 player myself so just speculating.)

So I wonder what then could have made the 4 player feel too constricting compared to 2 player? Also I wonder if the new players felt the frustration more because they weren't as able to shift strategies when something was full. So were you personally more frustrated than 2 player, or just feeling the pain from those at the table?

From the FAQ:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When it says ALL does that mean all other action spaces for that season are taken up OR does it mean all of the other action spaces for that particular action?

We've currently interpreted this as the latter one as technically you could always put works on hire out and on your Yoke, if you have one.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You interpreted it correctly--it's all action spaces for that particular action. I need to clarify that in the rules. Thanks!

After alot of Viticulture plays this weekend, we discovered there wasn't much use for Lira towards end of game. Because of this, we came up with a great variant that A) rewards hitting that 5th shipment and B) provides another path to victory without changing gameplay.

The Variant
At game end after the final residual payments have gone out in the last year, players are allowed to trade in Lira for VP's at a rate of $10 to 1. There is no limit to the amount of VP's that can be gained this way.

Played this a few times and REALLY enjoyed the last year and the jockeying for cash and/or shipments. Nothing like getting a bonus VP from your residual payments for getting 5 shipments out the door!

EDIT: had a chance to play a few more games and have since adjusted the payout to a $10:1 end game rate.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So you had that happen at the very end of the last year?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yep, we play out the entire last year as you've written, including final residual payments and then everyone may trade in Lira at a rate of $5 to 1. Played fantastically!

We couple this with the turn order variant I posted for a no nonsense, knockdown drag out worker placement battle of wits!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 982650:
Do you have to execute the summer/winter helper card that you draw in the Fall if you have the capability to do so? Most of the cards are awesome and you do want to execute it, but some of them may be harmful to your strategy depending on when you draw them. For example, you draw the Peddler "Discard 2 cards and draw 1 of each type of card (max of 4)." What if I want to keep all the cards I have, i.e. I have plans to use them all, and I don't want to discard two of them to get four more cards, do I have to execute the card? If I don't, what happens to it? Does it go into the discard pile or does it go into my hand?

Another example, you draw the Crusher "Crush grapes into any or all types of wine." It may actually hurt your strategy to crush at that time because you're waiting for the grapes to mature or maybe you want to sell them later, do you have to crush?

Additionally, what if you can't legally execute the card, i.e. you don't have the lira required or something else, what happens to the card?

At the moment, we have house ruled that if you don't want to execute it when you draw then you don't have to and the card goes into the discard pile.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you draw a visitor during the fall, it simply goes into your hand. You do not automatically play it. If and when you wish to use the card you place a worker in the appropriate action space. But no actions are taken in the fall season, only drawing cards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You might have mistaken about the rule. In the Fall, you only draw visitor card(s).

You play them when you put workers onto the summer or winter visitor space.

Of course, you have to meet all the requirement of the card in order to play them. IE: If the card tells you to give everyone 1 lira, but you're not able to, you can't play that card.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 982442:
I'm playing a solo 2-player game right now and have a question on the Crush Expert card. It states, "Crush grapes into any or all types of wine and draw 1 purple card". I have on my crush pad a 9 red grape and 4 white grape. Does this card let me turn the grapes into multiple wines? Can I use it to make a sparkling and a red, with what I have?

The Crush Grapes action wouldn't let me do this right? If the card doesn't let me do this, then the only difference between the card and action space is the +1 card?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The "Crush Grapes" location on the board allows you to crush 1 type of wine. You may crush only 1 type of wine (Red, White, Rose, or Sparkling), but you can crush multiple grapes into multiple wines. For example, you have red grapes of value 2, 3, and 5; and white grape of 1, 2, and 6. When you "crush grape", you first announce what type of wine you're crushing/making. If you want to make red wine, you can crush your 2, 3, and/or 5 grapes into 1~3 bottle of wines(value 2, 3, and/or 5).

The card allows you to crush any or all type of wines, meaning you can make red and white and rose at the same time.

Loving Viticulture bu I've noticed towards the end of the game there aren't alot of uses for cash (unless you've got the cash for VP's summer action card). Am I missing something? It just seems that once I get a steady flow of cash going I don't have much use for it. Granted the game is usually in its final year or two anyways, but I hate seeing a stack of Lira stockpiled with nothing to do with it! Is there some obscure rule for trading in cash at end of game that I'm missing (ala Carson City)? I'm thinking of creating a variant for end game where you can trade 4 or 5 lira for VP's in the final year. Will playtest and report back.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not sure how you managed to get a steady flow of cash because the two games we've played so far, we've always struggle to get money to do things.

But, looking forward to how your idea plays in case we get to the point of having a lot of money at the end. It is nice for those games that let you count your resources for VPs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've ended every play so far in the same situation. Approaching 20 lire with nothing to buy. A tasting room can be nice at that point, but using it just continues to add to your cash on hand.

My wife and I have considered a variant for two players where two slots are open on each work space, but to use the second one, you have to pay one lira more than your current residual payment. That would be a fantastic use for late game cash. I plan to report on it after trying it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm intrigued by WDP's concept. Otherwise cash only helps you buy buildings late in the game for a few extra VPs or to break a tie. Given that, I would suggest adjusting the amount of lira you pursue earlier in the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I had the same thought when I playtested an early version of the PnP (without the expansion), but I was only able to play that version a couple of times, and I have only played the final version (with the expansion) once. My thought was to add an alternate action to the Yoke (usable in winter or summer) that would let you buy VPs at a steep price -- e.g., 8 lire. Thematically, though, using the Yoke to buy VP does not make much sense. Instead, the variant could be that if you own a Tasting Room, when you give a tour, instead of getting money and 1 VP, you can buy up to 3 VP for 6 lire each. Think of it as giving a free tour/tasting to wine critics. I propose the price of 6 lire with a limit of 3 because, IIRC, one of the visitors lets you buy points at 3 lire each with a limit of 3, so double that price seems reasonable. And by requiring use of the Give a Tour space, which is a very popular space, the strategy would not be overpowering because the action could be blocked (unlike using the Yoke).

I am considering this variant not only because cash becomes less useful at the end of the game, but also because I really like games with multiple strategies, so I would like a cash-heavy strategy to be viable. I don't mean to imply that the current design has shortcomings, or that multiple strategies do not already exist (the player who came in a close second behind me did not fulfill any wine orders -- he just kept choosing the 1 VP turn order bonus, boosting his morale back to the maximum, and giving tours with a Tasting Room), but having a viable cash strategy would add more variety.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a card that lets you turn cash into VP.

Also, cash is the first tie breaker. In our game, I hoarded cash at the end, luckily, as I won on the tiebreaker.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I won my second game with the lira tie breaker as well. Plus, I fill exactly one order the whole game. I utilize the sixth wake up spot, giving tour, selling wines, and planting vines, with some help from the visitor cards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Played a couple games yesterday and have settled on 5 Lira and no VP limit at end of game. Works REALLY well and definitely adds another layer of depth without complicating the game. Just another path to victory . 5 Lira just so happens to be the highest residual payment you can get too. Nothing like being rewarded at end of game with 1 extra VP for managing to get 5 shipments out the door.


Variant posted here:
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/12409679#12409679
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After two sessions, I am definitely seeing a build up of cash with nothing to do with it at the end of the game. It's especially frustrating with the residual payments, since nobody seemed to need money anymore by the time they started rolling in.

I definitely want to try the "5 lira => VP" exchange variant at the endgame. Thanks for the suggestion.

I may also try the "1 lira / worker" annual upkeep cost variant at some point.

Still loving this game.

---Matt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tonight playing 2 player, I was sitting at 17 vp at the start of the year, used the Summer visitor card that allows you to trade up to 12 Lira for 3 VP and won the game that way, but I still had plenty of "useless" gold built up by the time the game ended.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, it's really not a game where you need to accumulate a lot of money.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unless of course you are really worried about that tie at the end of the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
True. Once players know what they're doing, games can end up being very close, so the tiebreaker definitely does matter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've only got 3 plays in so take this with a grain of salt, but it seems to me that if you have a ton of Lira at the end of the game that maybe the game has gone on too long.

But perhaps that is not true and I haven't played enough.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On this topic, it seems weird that for the expansion, you can't opt to give your workers excess money to keep their morale up. I would think most would prefer an end of year bonus in cash rather than apple juice
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's a good point, Richard.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wonder what a fair bonus would be. Apples are the cheapest bonus because they only require harvesting and no further processing (or crushing), but you still needed to prepare your field with a planting action. On the other hand, you can just take the leisure action each time, so the bonus is only worth one worker. A 1 lira bonus seems too low, even though you are losing only 1 lira by giving away an apple rather than selling it. If you assume that a worker allocated to leisure could have been used to give a tour, then maybe a bonus is only worth 2 lire, which is the payoff of a tour.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think that's a fair calculation, Sharon.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After more than half a dozen plays, our experience has been similar to Sky Zero and WDP. We've often seen an accumulation of money in the closing stages, and this isn't a result of pursuing money too early, but is rather a result of income being generated from things like residual payments.

It does seem somewhat strange that the game rewards you with money in the closing stages (e.g. via residual payments), but there's there's very little you can do with the money at this point of the game (unless you happen to have the card that lets you convert it to points, or if you go to a tie-breaker). You could buy a windmill or winetasting room with your cash, but in the last couple of rounds this will rarely lead to points so it's not really worthwhile shelling out money or using a worker to do this.

As a result, we've often seen players end with a significant cash reserve that isn't a result of them playing inefficiently, but is rather a result of the game's design. It seems unsatisfactory to be generating extra money in the closing stages if there's little you can do with it and no reward for it - something does seem to be missing from the game here.

I like Sky Zero's suggested variant of
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; we've played this way once already and quite liked it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We address this in a number of ways with Tuscany, but I agree that in the original game of Viticulture, even if you manage your money really well, by the end of the game you're getting residuals that have no translation to points or value.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 982302:
After a few games of Viticulture it's quickly rising to the top of my favorites in the worker placement genre. One change I've made though is to the turn order mechanic. We've playtested 3 games now simply using the following variant:

The Variant
First, the bonus selection during the spring is determined by the order in which you passed during the previous winter phase. Turnorder for the subsequent summer and winter is then determined by the bonus you select.

That's it. Simple and strategic making passing early a viable strategy. Give it a try, I don't ever see myself not playing this way again!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How about at the start of the game? I suggest choosing in random order in the first spring.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We roll a dice for start of game bonus order selection, but feel free to use whatever method you'd like.

Hilo ID 982128:
Upgrade your cellar - does this mean "build the next larger cellar building". There was a question in our game about whether this meant losing your medium and getting a large (since you were "upgrading").
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It means "build the next larger cellar building".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agreed. I think only the Handyman causes you to lose a structure (by turning it into another structure).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And as per Jamey the designer's note in FAQs, you can't "turn" the middle cellar into large cellar.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It makes sense that you cannot sacrifice a medium cellar to get a large cellar because the large cellar is just an extension to the medium cellar (just as the medium is an extension to the small cellar). Also, the rule prevents a discontinuity when you age your wines.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just to be sure:

with the uncertified oenologist.

You can upgrade your cellar for 1 VP.

You don't have to pay the cost for the cellar as well?

So, it's upgrade/build the next cellar for 1 VP. Or 1 VP AND 4/6 coins?

Upgrade from medium cellar to large cellar for 1 VP seems overpowered?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Connor: When you upgrade your cellar, you place the next cellar token (medium if you only have a small cellar, large if you already built the medium cellar). So the cost is only the 1 VP if you have that visitor card. Thus it's more strategic to build the medium cellar on a previous action, then use that card, but sometimes you might use the card right away to get a much-needed medium cellar.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 982123:
Draw 3 cards of different types. Each other player draws 1 card of a type you didn't choose.

Does each card have to be a different type or can you draw say 2 green, 1 yellow? The wording makes it ambiguous as it sounds like the other players may choose among the types not picked (rather than THE type not picked).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They all have to be of different types (none thee same).

I think the "types" allows for players to choose expansion cards. In the base game, they won't have a choice of what type.

Edit: I wonder what happens if one or more of the decks are empty (and the no discards)? Can you play the card or not?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It seems clear from the wording that each card must be a different type. With the expansion there are now 5 decks of cards, so the active player chooses 3 types of cards, and the other players can choose between the 2 remaining decks. With just the base game, you're right - the other players don't get a choice of decks.

I've played a 6-player game, and it's highly unlikely any deck will be completely depleted (no draw or discard pile). We did cycle through the visitor decks a couple of times, but players were always trying to play visitors, so there was no shortage of discards.

I'm going to get my first multi-player game of Viticulture in this afternoon. It will likely be a 4-6 player game with experienced gamers. Everyone will be new to the game. I've read a few posts that say the Grande Worker is a must addition to the base game, and will likely be included in future printings of the base game. So, my question is:

Should I include the Grande Worker in my first game, when everyone is new to the game? If yes, why? What "problem" is the Grande Worker supposed to "fix"?

Also, if the Grande Worker is included in the base game, will the max. workers per player still be six, or seven?

Thanks in advance for you advice.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've only played one incomplete game, so I really have no feel for whether or not the grande worker is a must for the base game, though I suspect that in a two player, it is.

However, I'm fairly sure that if you do include it, the worker limit is still six.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Having just did this last night I say YES! The Grande Worker is a stroke of genius and really adds another layer of depth to the game without changing the rules. There is nothing more satisfying than pulling off a 2 card winter or summer action combo and leaping into first! I will always play the game with the Grande Worker under all circumstances.


And yep, limit is still 6 workers.

Hilo ID 981819:
This was our second time playing, but we added the Arboriculture expansion. At 1 pm we started setting up and learning the expansion rules. At 1:20 we started playing and finished around 2:45 pm. So we cut our playing time down by 35 minutes. I think the game can be played in a shorter amount of time, but we’re not fast players. We like to think about our choices, plus my husband Will needs time to read the card text on his closed circuit television due to his vision disabilities. I point this out so that people will know that this game can be played faster than an hour and 25 minutes.

Anyway, Will got 2 buildings out quickly with the Uncertified Architect summer visitor card. Seeing that he was going the traditional route, I decided to try a risky strategy of choosing the 6 wake up to get VPs every turn, build the wine tasting room and focus on getting my morale up. I also used left-over workers to gain money at the help wagon at the end of every year.

Will kept using the tour spot so I wasn’t able to win VP that way until the final round, but I got the Auctioneer summer visitor and threw away 4 cards to earn 2 vp. The turn before I had used my grande worker on the draw wine order cards so it was easy to choose what to discard.

I was able to get the morale track up pretty easily, took two years, and then I just made sure to keep a worker to use the leisure space every year to gain a VP or use the grande worker to play a visitor card. Nice mechanic. Especially with having useful visitor cards, some of which gave me VP. Which is why I made sure to build the cottage to get 2 visitor cards each year.

Have to say that my strategy was a bit obvious in its aggression and pretty sure it wouldn’t work in a game with more players, but in a 2 player game, there’s only one person to mess with me. And it really stressed out my husband the whole game.

Grande worker is definitely a must for all games from now on. It actually gives us a chance of bonuses since we’ll mostly play 2 players. But I do like the additional products and the morale for the expansion. And it seems to speed the game up, though that could have been because of my aggressive strategy.

Have to say, it feels like a cheap way to win by being lazy. How can I be the best vineyard if I don’t make anything? Sure, everyone is very happy, but I must be running in the red. Oh I know - all the employees are so happy that they tell everyone what a great place it is so lots of people come to visit and pay just to see the place… yeah, that makes sense! Sort of … lol! Better than what establishment my husband said I must be running… ;-)

Halfway through, Will did fill a wine order with the Marketer winter visitor and put in an olive oil to get 6 points total. I was at 12 at this point. This is the part that worried me. If he could fill enough orders, he could catch up to my slow, constant crawl forward.

Even though he continued to draw wine orders and make wine, he wasn’t able to fill wine orders and also he struggled to keep his morale above the negative line. Finally, he passed at the beginning of summer, which blew my mind. I was at 16 so I knew he was probably trying something desperate. Unbeknownst to him I had the Broker summer visitor card. So I gave a tour with worker to get a VP and 2 lira to add to the 7 lira I had been slowly accumulating with the help wagon. Then I used the grande worker to play the Broker, which upped my morale track to gain a VP. With the Broker, I traded in 9 lira for 3 VP so I got to 21.

To catch up, Will played Master Vitner winter visitor card to increase a wine and fill an order. That got him 5 points with an olive oil to bump him up to 11. Then he had to harvest, crush and then fill a wine order with the grande worker to get him 4 points with a final total of 15.

In the end, I have to say, I’ll never use that strategy again. That was the easiest euro game I’ve ever played. In fact, at several points, I had to tell myself to stop thinking so I wouldn’t get distracted and veer off my lazy course. I never got an extra worker. I only had the grande worker and 2 basic workers. And it was very easy to decide what to do. But I like to play euro games to challenge my mind and this was no challenge. I got to sing and dance my way to victory. Sure I worried that Will could catch up, but there wasn’t much I could do about that. I just had to continue to party with my people and hope the happiness was enough to bring it all home.

Will, on the other hand, worked his butt off, stressed out, thought very very hard and still couldn’t catch up to me even though he saw what I was doing from the very beginning. He did realize later that there were a few things he could have done differently. Like he could have built the Wine Tasting Room instead of the Windmill so he could have gotten a VP for each time he used the tour. Which, I think would have gotten him very close to my score as I think he used the tour spot at least 5 times.

Next time we play, I’ll have to try to keep track of how many years it takes, but I don’t think this one got above 7 years or so. The first two years I only got 1 point per year, but as soon as I got my morale up, I was gaining 2 points per year. Then there were a few years I got an extra point from visitor cards and finally that big jump at the end.

I’m not sure if we’ll play with all of the expansion next time. Will feels like the morale track is kind of distracting and breaks the game a little. I don’t think that’s true unless someone employs the strategy I did. I think we need to try it again with more normal strategies and see how we both feel about the extra produce. But the grande worker is a must and I’m glad to see from Jamey’s comments that the next edition will have the grande worker in the base game. I really think it needs it, especially for the 2 player game, but I imagine even for more players, it will speed up the game immensely.

Oh, one minor note about the player boards. Like many other games with player boards of this thickness, the corners are curling up. No big deal. We’ll just do what we did with the boards from other games and put them under a large stack of heavy games for a while to flatten them out. If anyone else has this issue, I highly recommend you do the same.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great to see this take on the game Sarah especially with the two player experience. Seeing as how I just backed for the retail copy on the Euphoria Kickstarter, I'll have to simulate the grande worker somehow until it is hopefully made available later as I know my wife will appreciate the faster game play.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great session report! One question though, I thought you only got the morale bonus one time when you got it to the top and not every year it stayed there. Maybe I'm mis-interpreting the rule? Anyways, thanks for the report and feedback on the expansion!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glad I could help! You could easily simulate the grande worker, just find another pawn shape in the same or similar color you are playing. Then when you start the game you start with the grande worker and 2 regular workers. Every time you place the grande worker on the main board, you get the bonus action. Though if you do end up putting him on the spot with the bonus icon, you only get the bonus once.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks! Morale decreases at the end of every year so you have to constantly raise it. So once you get it to the VP line, you just have to keep a worker for either the leisure spot or use the grande worker on the play a visitor card since you put a heart token over the bonus icon on those two locations. Hope that makes sense.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you Sarah, great session report. I've been on the fence about putting Viticulture in my Euphoria pledge and was getting worried hearing some of the early feedback with 2-player games taking a long time and being very competitive. Now this variant seems like it opens up the game so much more and makes it play a little faster. Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've played quite a few two player games, and even without the expansion or the Grande Worker, we've really enjoyed it. But I agree that with two players, the Grande Worker is the way to go as it makes alternate paths to victory much more accessible. Once you go Grande you never go back!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome! I think Viticulture really is a good game, but yes, for some people, the 2-player game can feel long. Me and my husband don't have this problem because we like long games. In fact, Viticulture is a short game to us since it only takes an hour and half to play. But I agree with Jeff - once you go Grande, you never go back!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just to add, I've been teaching with the Grand worker for 2 games now, to different people, gamers and non-gamers alike. They have no problem with them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So far from what we have played:

The game plays MUCH different with even and odd players. 3 player games seem to be easier than 2 player games.

The grande worker is a nice touch in speeding the game along. More so in 2 player games.

In 2 player games it is just a limit in resource spots, so any bonus will help.

We are going to try another variant later where in 2 player games you can pay 2 coin (+difference in residual pay) to occupy a 2nd space. Right now getting some 3-5 player games in with family in town.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Looking forward to how this variant plays.

We're also going to try some tweaks to the expansion next time we play.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 981816:
Anyone use the expansion yet? Thoughts? Is it worth the additional upkeep?

BTW, played my first game earlier today and my initial impressions are this "might" dethrone the other wine games on the market. Gonna play a few more times before passing judgement, but out of the gate, I really like this one over at least Vinhos.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've never played Vinhos, so I can't comment about that.

But we did just play with the expansion for the first time. I liked it, but my husband is unsure about it. The morale track can be distracting. If it's not part of your strategy as a way to earn VPs, it will be a struggle to keep it above the negative line so as not to lose VP. So I can imagine that some people will not like it just for that.

I think the additional produce can be useful in pumping up the value of wine orders, but it's also more steps that you have to take to process the tomatoes and olives.

The expansion definitely makes it much more valuable to get all your workers as early as possible. This is the best way to utilize the extra crops. But if you do not get extra workers, it will be a struggle.

However, there is one thing that everyone should play with in all their games and that is the grande worker. You can use it separately from the expansion and just use it in the base game. The grande worker allows you to gain the bonus from the middle space when putting a worker on one of the other spaces. This opens up bonuses for 2-player games since they are not accessible. I also firmly believe it will speed up a game with more players because more people will be gaining bonuses.

So in the end, I can take or leave the extra crops in the expansion, but the grande worker is a must!

Hope that helps.

When taking the plant vine bonus action, can one choose a different field for the second vine, or does one have to plant both vines in the same field.

Thanks in advance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thomas: You get to take the "plant vine" action twice. So you get to plant one vine in any applicable field, and then you get to plant another vine in any applicable field. Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks much.

We debated this in our game last night briefly, and came to the incorrect conclusion.

I'm pretty impressed with your game, so far. I'm very much looking forward to playing it again in the near future.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 981164:
First let me say that I really like this game as is, and this variant is not intended to be an "improvement", simply a different way to play that may appeal to some people.

Some folks I'ved gamed with don't like worker placement games because, as they would say, "it doesn't make sense that just because you planted your field I can't plant mine." Then there is the fact that the first time one plays a worker placement game it is difficult to really have a sense of what to do and in what order, and learning the building strategy can be frustrated as you also learn the worker placement strategy.

Because of these two factors I recently played a game with a few people who weren't really gamers and decided to play such that everyone could place a worker on any space they wanted to. We still played that only the first person to play at a given space could claim the bonus, so turn order remained somewhat important.

The results were:

1. Each player could focus on learning how to manage their vineyard without the frustration of not being able to do what they wanted to do.
2. The game went pretty fast since everyone could always harvest, crush, and sell wine.
3. Turn order was still important in terms of being able to choose which wake-up bonus you would receive and then being able to claim the bonuses on the action spaces.
4. Everyone seemed to enjoy the game, even those who don't normally like worker placement games.

Although I still prefer the game in its original form, I think I may continue to use this variant whenever I'm teaching people how to play. That way they can learn most of the mechanics in the context of an actual game, the first game will be over pretty quickly, and then we can play again- and perhaps add the original rules regarding worker placement. As we played I found myself providing commentary such as, "okay, so normally that action would be full now and no one else could play there this turn." just to prepare them for the "real" game.

I think this is also a good way to play with kids, sort of a family version that focuses on what you can do, rather than what you can't.

Anyway, just thought I'd share that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I like the family friendly notion of the variant but don't understand why you'd play a game with folks who don't like worker placement. It'd be like breaking out Yahtzee with a group who said they hate dice games.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm guessing that he's playing with non-gamers, or "gamers lite". Perhaps they *believe* they don't like worker placement games because the mechanic is new to them.

Most non-gamers I try to bring into the hobby, "don't like games" because they don't know what the words "board game" means these days, and they don't know mechanisms besides roll-and-move.

I wouldn't want to play with this variant if I could help it, but honestly I came to this thread assuming I would be annoyed by the OPs post, and now I feel like it's a post worth defending. Let them experience how the game comes together in a open and friendly way, before you entice them into playing it properly!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeff--This is an interesting variant you mention here. We've been considering making a lighter version of the game for families and non-gamers, and this might be a step in the right direction!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sky - The answer to the question "why would I play this game with people who do not like worker placement" is simply because I think the game is great and want to play it! So I figured if I could remove the only real objection to playing the game, and still have a fun gaming experience, why not? And if I can ultimately change their mind about worker placement games, that's a bonus.

Dan - I'm glad I didn't annoy you. I probably could have come up with a better title for the thread because mine does sound like I'm complaining about the game, which I'm not. In retrospect, a much better title would have been something like "A variant for new players and families." I too am often annoyed by people who post variants for brand new games claiming that they have "fixed them" or "improved them" when the reality is they probably don't fully have a solid grasp of the game design themselves yet. That certainly wasn't my intention, so I'm glad you didn't read that into my post.

Jamey - Thanks for the kind words. As I've said, I really enjoy this game "as is." In fact, after about 10 games I can only come up with two small nitpicks. One is that the glass beads are just a bit too large (or the grape and wine spaces are a bit too small) and the other is that on the vine cards the red grapes are listed in the left column and the white grapes are on the right, but on the player cards the white grapes are on the left and the red are on the right. In my first few games I kept putting the red grapes on the white spaces and vice versa! Beyond those two small issues (which really aren't issues in terms of gameplay) I have nothing but great things to say about the game, and hopefully in the future I will be able to encourage a few more folks to grab a copy.


On a side note, in some two player games we just started using the Grande Worker and that has really opened things up. I'm still hoping to get a 5 or 6 player game in soon. The game I referenced above was only three players.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Jeff! Those are reasonable nitpicks. I'm glad you're starting to use the Grande Worker! That guy is awesome.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think this would be a great way to introduce this game to new players who aren't familair with the mechanics. I like that you told them how it normally played as you went along so they knew that this was just a teaching game. But still, it would be a good variant for families as it takes down the barrier that kids might have in grasping the concept of limited placement.

We've only played 1 game so far, with 2 players, and it was a tough game. I am looking forward to adding in the expansion, which I imagine we'll always play with moving forward to broaden the options for the 2 player game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I changed my original thread title to better reflect the intended positive nature of the post.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeff, as you correctly surmised, the title of your post did make it sound as if you were saying the game was annoying, and you were proposing how to fix it. You also correctly surmised that a pet peeve of mine is gamers house-ruling games that they don't fully understand.

As it stands, your post offers a potential way to introduce non-gamers or "confrontation averse" gamers to any worker placement games. I think your new title is an improvement. The title now matches the high quality of your post.

Just got my game today and I must say, even in shrink, it's an impressive box and I have a LOT of games in my collection. It's pretty special when something new stands out, even before being opened!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's great to hear, Dan!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 980939:
We got the game in the mail at 4:30 pm. Excited to give it a try, we ate a quick dinner. At 5:30, we opened the box, punched everything out and started reading through rules. We started playing at 6:30 pm and finished around 8:30.

The first year was very frustrating for me since I wasn’t first and everything I wanted to do, my husband did. With 2 players, only one spot per action place is available. So at first, it felt like he got ahead of me with him building the trellis, plant vines and getting another worker in his first year. However, as time progressed I was able to get more cards and I must say that those visitor cards make all the difference. When I was able to go first, I took the key spots and denied him actions, but often when it was his turn to go first, I was able to play visitor cards and do a lot of the actions he had already taken. And then as he wanted to play visitor cards, I took the spots first. So he had a hand full of cards that he couldn’t use and I was quickly moving ahead. So having visitor cards and knowing when to use them is very critical in this game.

There was some competition as we were both trying to fill orders, but I was able to do it a little better than him. I ended the game with 20 points while he was still at 14.

The other key thing is building structures and knowing which ones to build. I actually purposefully kept my cellar at medium size for a while so I could have the right sized wines for the wine orders. My husband did manage to build the Wine Tasting Room, but then I did my best to do tours before him to deny him points. But other than building the Trellis and Irrigation first, the yoke is very important for having that extra harvesting spot.

One of the best years I had was when I was able to use a visitor card to harvest, then use the board space to harvest and then the yoke space to harvest so I got all three of my fields harvested. That set me up really nicely for crushing grapes and filling orders.

The smallest thing tripped us up at the beginning of the game. I didn’t know what a pinot vine card was. Neither of us drink wine, though I have had some wine in the past. I didn’t think to look at the face of the vine cards to look for the one labeled pinot. And since there weren’t pictures in the rules, we were a little lost at first until my husband said to turn the cards over and look at the faces. Then voila! I saw pinot on one of the cards.

I think the only other thing we had a question about was some of the visitor cards told you to choose 2 options and listed 3 options. It wasn’t clear if you could choose the same option twice, but for now, we ruled that you could not.

And the only mistake we know we made is that the first time I crushed grapes, I crushed both a 1 white and a 1 red, but we made up for it later by allowing my husband to crush an extra grape. Even though he ended up crushing a higher value, it still didn’t help him. I managed to really lock him down.

So in summary, we love this game! It didn’t feel like it took too long. Yes, it’s slow to ramp up and then it rushes towards an end, but that’s okay. We like the rhythm of it, the flow of gameplay and we feel we understand it well enough that the next time we play, we’ll include the arboriculture expansion and see what new options that unlocks!

Our decision to fund this game was definitely a good one. I do not regret it at all. The only thing I regret is not having found the Kickstarter sooner and having the money to pay for myself to be drawn into the game. The art is beautiful! All of the components are excellent – the unique meeples go above and beyond what I’ve seen in any other game. Very classy! And the exclusive box sleeve really looks like a wooden crate of wine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Me and my wife said the exact same thing!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great session report! My first play (also 2p) experience was very similar to yours (except we had to abandon the game 75% of the way through).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ryan - glad to know we're not alone.

Simon - sorry to hear you didn't get to finish your first game. I hope your next game(s) go better.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Playing my first game this weekend and can't wait. Great session report!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks! I hope you'll write a report of your experiences too.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for sharing your experience, Sarah!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I plan on it!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good! Looking forward to it.

Welcome Jamey! Thanks for making a great game!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll be able to play my first game against human players on Saturday. I'm playing a solo 2-player game right now to lock in the rules, and I'm experiencing the same thing as Sarah. One player was able to build early structures, which enabled the plant-harvest-crush-sell process. However, the other player drew more cards and was able to get some high-value wine order cards (which required sparkling wine), which drove him to focus on income and structures. Even though the one player fulfilled a couple of early orders, the other player eventually caught up by fulfilling a better order and by having the windmill built before planting any vines.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well said, Matt. I think it's good for new players to hear that there isn't a set path to victory. You have to remain nimble early on if the spots on the board you wanted get taken.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for adding your experiences Matt! It's definitely helpful to learn from others. This game may trip up some people, but the trick is not to focus too much on one strategy and adapt to what is going on.

Exactly Jamey - I definitely feel that you have to have a nimble mind when playing this game. I think that's why I had a bit of an edge over Will in that he plays a lot of games the way he plays chess - planning 10 moves ahead. Obviously that works for some games, which he regularly beats me at, but for Viticulture it does not. I had a few things I was tyring to do, but I wasn't planning far ahead so I did better. We'll see what happens when Will learns to adapt, though. I'm in trouble!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great review!

A friend of mine has
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
and i wonder what are the difference between Viticulture and vinhos, where you have to place the best wine in fairs and else... could someone summarize what are the main differences?

thanks in advance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Sarah

Nice session report - thanks for sharing .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The key when you're not the first player is to choose another strategy than your opponent. There are other ways to earn victory points than making wine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The vines are also listed in the table on page 5 of the rules.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I completely agree, I feel that I've gotten good value for my money and is happy to have supported a very classy company.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry to say that I have never played Vinhos, but I do think there have been threads around BGG comparing these two games. Check the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
or
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
forums to see if anyone has talked about it.

From what little I know of Vinhos, Viticulture is very very different in how it plays and what the goals are. I think I heard that Vinhos is a weightier game, but not everyone agrees with that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Morten! Glad you liked my session report.

I definitely learned to change my strategy, which is how I managed to win. It was just a bit startling at first so I wanted to let others know about it.

Thanks for pointing out where the vines are. I should have looked through the rules for it.

I have yet to get other Kickstarter games as Viticulture was the first one I supported, however, I have not seen any of the other companies go to the lengths that Jamey has in communicating and producing a fantastic product. Stonemaier games is definitely a company I'll be following and supporting. They are definitely a classy company.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A couple of differences between Vinhos and Viticulture.

Vinhos is a Rondel mechanic vs worker placement.
It only has 6 rounds while Viticulture is finished when hitting 20 points...not rounds.
In Vinhos, your wine can spoil. It stays nice and fresh in Viticulture.

Viticulture rules are straightforward, well written and easy to undertand. Vinhos takes a few readings because there are so many different things you have to keep up with.

I'm just highlighting a few differences. I like both games. I think Vinhos is a little more complex, but Viticulture has been really enjoyable for my first two plays. I'm looking forward to playing it again. Hope this helps
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I finally finished my trial game last night (had to take my son to Mackinac Island on a 2-day field trip). The green player, who built early structures and filled early wine orders, won the game 20-17. The yellow player made a critical error on the last turn, using a winter visitor to fill a wine order (to get +1 VP), instead of blocking the fill wine order spot on the board. This allowed the green player to harvest (with the yoke), crush and fill a 6-VP wine order card.

Even though green seemed to have a better start, once yellow got his better vines planted and started making sparkling wine, it became a back and forth game. One concern I had was how the early wine orders the green player completed helped him get a leg up on the residual income track. This allowed him to train more workers, which in turn allowed him to do more each year. Even though yellow seemed to be in the VP race, green just seemed to always be in a stronger position overall (more cash, more workers, etc). I'll have to play more games to determine if filling some small wine orders early always leads to a stronger mid-late game position.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have played twice now. Three player game, very enjoyable. Four player game, frustrating and dull.

There is just not enough spots for workers to be placed in a 4p game. I suspect the 5p game would also be good as it opens up a third spot. I think a 6 player game would be ordinary as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have had 2 3p game, 2 4p game, and 1 5p game. The first 3p game, we are all learning the game, and I got a rule wrong, so there's some hiccup, but all players are intrigued.

Just had another 3p game(with Grand worker) this past afternoon, with a gamer and a non-gamer. Being the experienced guy, I won, but both of them had 1x point, so it wasn't so bad.

My first 4p game was without Grand Worker, and the game is certainly tighter. Everyone is blocking everyone else. My second 4p game was with Grand worker, and the players all feel like it make the game not so tight.

5p game was also a blast, it just take a bit longer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you all for adding your experiences with more players in the game. I have a feeling that the 2, 4 and 6 player games will always feel tight and a bit frustrating without the Grande Worker while the 3 and 5 player games will be easier regardless of whether the Grande Worker is included.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have played twice. The first time with three players, very enjoyable. The second time with four and it stank. The frustration at lack of choice made progress in the game way too hard to be fun.

Which then led to us being critical of the theme implementation. If we all have our own vineyards, if we have the workers, why can't we:
- all run tours
- all plant vines
- all sell grapes
- all play cards
- all crush grapes
- all harvest
- all fill orders?

I may have this wrong, but I understand you can't place in the bonus option unless you can use it (no blocking). This makes it even harder in the early stages as it makes another space unavailable (play two cards) if nobody can use it (making only one space available).

The two I understand are building structures and training workers - because you perhaps need to engage someone else to work on your farm.

Next time we play we are going to try with all three spaces available, regardless of how many of us play.

From the chest puffing in the description:
1. Balances, I want players to walk away from the game feeling elated, not frustrated. It's not true.

2. Scaleability: I think this might be the true genius of the game (if I may say so myself). Your genius assessment could do with a review. Fails badly at four, probably worse at six.

3. Replayability: Viticulture has tons of paths to victory, most by choice, but some are affected by luck and the choices other players make. Disagree, you are running a vineyard, making wine is what you are there to do. You can get other points in other ways but not as a path to victory.

4. Production: You're truly producing something. This I agree with, but ONLY if you can select the options that enable you to do this.

5. Turn order: We borrowed the best element from Fresco and put it in our game. Simply rotating the first player choice is hardly original. Worker placement to get it would be better.

6. Duration: I think the ideal board game is one in which you get to build something new and incredible in 45-60 minutes, several times in the same night. Love to hear from anyone who has come close to this time frame. After the 4p frustration I can't imagine the group I played with ever wanting to play it again.

7. Counting Victory Points vs. Ending the Game at a Certain Threshold: This works. 1.5/7, not a great score for chest beating.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Warren, you can play in the bonus spot if there are no other spots available.

People made this complaint about Agricola too; "I can't bake bread because she did????" It's a game!!!

I agree this game is a lot tighter (and heavily and longer) than I expected from Jamey's the early descriptions. But expectations aside, it's a good game.

The alternative paths to victory do work. Someone wrote a session report on it recently. Although no one tried it in the 6p game we played.

I'd prefer a different turn order mechanic too.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I agree, thought it was a good game for three, horrible for four, likely to be okay for five, stink for sex six
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use the Grande Worker....always. Game is fantastic with any number using the Grande Worker!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 980811:
I like the wake-up turn order mechanic in this game, but it does seem a little strange that the first choice marker simply rotates around the table. It seems to me that turn order is crucial in the last year of the game, and I think it's important at the beginning too, as players try to get their key improvements built (depending on their strategy).

Particularly in the final year of the game, it seems that turn order will often be determined by where you happen to be sitting, as people will choose as early as they can. I think the benefits of going first (actions) pretty much outweigh the bonuses (cards, money, extra workers etc) at this point (although an extra point is nice).

I wondered if anyone had considered a turn order variant? I was wondering about something like Caylus, where the first person to "pass" for the year gets the first choice of when to wake up, etc... So it really pays to be efficient and pass as early as possible.

A problem with this might be that the first player might often be able to pass first, and so keep his/her wakeup time. It also doesn't help balance turn order at the start of the game. And ideas?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm willing to bet Jamey tested this and found it to be a bit too cut-throat for the type of game he wanted to create. I already intend to variant the start track by "whenever you pass you decide where you go on the wake-up track the next round by putting your rooster in the spot you want (right side of track)". This makes passing early a viable strategy in the game which I like. It's a fair and balanced trade-off to pass early for the opportunity to go first in a later round.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 980657:
I'm on the Crush Grapes +1 bonus space that lets me add 1 to the resulting wine token(s). Let's say I'm making blush wine and have a value 2 Red and a value 1 white. Normally I would not be able to make a blush since the minimum value is 4. However, can I use the +1 bonus to bump the blush wine up to 4 and place a token?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ron--Great question! I actually had to check on the wording in the rules for this one. "A player may choose the middle action space to increase the
value of all wine created from that "crush grapes" action by +1."

Based on that, I think it's fair to combine a 2 red and 1 white with the +1 bonus to get a 4 blush!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Jamey! The game looks fantastic!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hmmm, I would have guessed the opposite since there is no such thing as a 3 value blush wine and the rules say that the value of the wine is increased, not the value of the grapes. So technically no wine was created by the crush, thus it cannot be increased.

But I have no problem being overruled by the game designer! This would be a good one for the FAQ
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I know Jamey has already ruled, but I agree with you. First, the crushed grapes have to be able to make a legal wine. Then that wine is increased in value by one. I think this is an easier ruling to explain to players, as it's not an exception to the normal crush grapes rule.

However, Jamey's ruling allows for clever play, which players always like to find in their games. So I will follow the official ruling. I guess that +1 spot allows for more clever crushing!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's a very grey area. I'm checking with my co-designer to see what he thinks. Thanks for your thoughts!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I hate to disagree with the game's creator, but this does not appear to be at all gray.

Your own rule book states quite clearly that the value of the wine, not the grapes, is increased. Since a value 3 blush cannot exist in the first place, I don't see how taking the middle crush space helps you at all.

If you intended this to be otherwise, you would need to issue an errata to the rules, I think.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thomas: Good point. I think it could be made more clear to say that you crush grapes, place the wine tokens on the cellar, and then increase the value of all wine created by +1. That would get rid of any ambiguity, as you would not be able to place the blush wine on the cellar in the first place given there's no place for it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So does this constitute an official ruling or simply continuing the discussion? No rush, just curious.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's an official ruling.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We took the +1 to mean we could crush a second lot of grapes!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
See I would have gone the other way, that choosing the +1 means either through luck or hiring a superior assistant you have produced a better value wine from inferior products, so you have managed to create a 4 value wine out of a 2 and a 1 value grape, which normally you wouldn't have the ability to do. With that reasoning it would allow creating a 4 blush from a 2 and a 1 with the +1 action spot.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just a note that this wording could be a little problematic if you already have a wine token on the space before you add 1 to it. E.g. You should be able to make a 7 value wine from a 6 value grape, even if you already have a 6 value wine. If you have to place it on the cellar first, it devalues to 5, and then you try to add 1...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George--That's a good point. I think that still applies. As long as there is a space where wine could be created, you can place a token in the cellar and then adjust it as needed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another question: If my cellar is currently max at 6, and I have only one 6 red grape. Would I be able to use the +1 spot on the Crush Grapes spot?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good question. No, you wouldn't be able to use it since you're not gaining anything from the +1. Thus you would need to choose a regular "crush grapes" action space.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamey, just to be clear, does this mean that if the 6 spot is taken in the cellar, then a crushed grape of value 6 would be devalued to the first available wine space below 6 in the cellar, and then the +1 effect would be applied, and the devalued wine would be now upvalued to the first available cellar space, which would be greater than 6? (Assuming there is an available space above 6)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kent--Kind of the opposite of that. The nuance above (with blush and sparkling wine) is that there needs to be an existing space for the wine--not necessarily an available space. So if you're trying to make a 6-value red wine and that spot is taken, and you use the +1 bonus, you would actually make a 7-value red wine.

This affirms to me that I need to change the crush action to proposed second-edition change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right. I understand the available space needed for Sparkling and Blush. I should have provided more context for my follow up question.

In general:

- is the +1 applied after placement into an available space (which may have required devaluing the grape to fill that available space)?
- if the next higher space is not available when adding the +1, is the wine receiving the +1 upvalued to the first available higher space, assuming that one exists?

Thanks.

Edited: to fix typos and to clarify
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kent - The +1 is applied as the piece is hovering in the air above a space in the cellar (before it leaves your hand). Any time a grape or wine token (regardless of bonuses) should be placed on the vineyard mat on a spot that is already taken, it is devalued down to the next available spot (it's never upvalued).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I really think the wine-order victory point totals will need to be re-balanced if you do that. Under your current version of the second edition rules, you can crush two blushes, a sparkling, and a white on the same turn with the bonus space; that can be ten-twelve points of wine orders in a single crush action. This will also reduce congestion at the crush winter space.

By contrast, if you put the limit on the number of grapes to be crushed instead (as was suggested by another person in another thread here in BGG, and I think I mentioned this in your feedback form as well), it will still require multiple actions to produce multiple quantities of these wines that generate the big victory point totals. I think this will be more in line with what you seemed to have aimed for.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks! That's exactly the clarification I was looking for. I thought one comment had mentioned upvaluing, which seemed like a contradiction to me, as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
True, but it still takes more wine tokens (and thus more harvesting) to get the tokens for blush and sparkling in the first place, not to mention the workers needed to get to the money to spend the money to build a medium/large cellar.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm firmly in the camp that the making wine action is fine just as it is. I think by changing you make the game too easy and uni-directional (since there would no longer be any reason NOT to try a strategy of fulfilling as many orders as possible). Everyone I've played it with has commented on how hard, yet rewarding, it is to fulfill the different wine orders, and how much planning it takes. If you could make any three kinds of wine, it require little or no planning, and would greatly reduce the tension for who can crush grapes in the later years.

Here is a possible meet-in-the-middle proposal:

Keep the crush grapes action as is, but change what the "+1" bonus space does. The player who takes the middle space may either increase the value (quality? I like quality better...) of all wine created during the action by 1, OR he or she may choose to make up to ONE wine token of a different type of wine.

Thus, the bonus action is left as is, if the player wants/needs that, but it also allows for a small amount of flexibility for making different wines.

I think this might also provide incentive for players to take the crush grapes action earlier in the game, instead of waiting to get a bunch (haha get it?!) of grapes and then crush to make a bunch of wine all at once.

Just my two lira...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I like the idea, and I definitely appreciate the thought process.

I should be clear, though, that I don't perceive this as a mechanical issue. Rather, it's just a really hard rule to explain and remember. It probably makes perfect sense to you at this point (as it does me), but many players struggle with it, and it leads to the game not being fun if you're confused or if you play incorrectly. So that's the root of the proposed change--clarity.

OK, maybe I'm missing something, but there is a sticker sheet in the box, that I have no clue what to do with...

Can someone help me out?

Check out Jamey's FAQ. The stickers are a Kickstarter bonus for customising your game if you want to (by sticking to the cards).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Simon! That is correct. I'm curious to see if people use the stickers. I might customize one of my copies so that each player mat has different prices on it. We might shuffle and deal them at the beginning of the game ala 7 Wonders.

I've seen this game described as light and medium-light and someone made a comment that comparing this game to Vinhos was like comparing Ticket to Ride to Steam. So I get that this is a light-ish game. But exactly how light is it? Is it Ticket to Ride light? Or was that comment only supposed to mean that it's lighter than a heavier game?

Someone give me an idea of a game that has the same weight as this game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan--I'm biased, but I'll chime in anyway. Also, I've taught the game more than anyone else, so I know for sure that the Ticket to Ride comparison isn't even close. Honestly, I was aiming to make a light game, but I ended up creating a medium game that will feel heavy to gamers who've never gone beyond Settlers or Ticket to Ride. Every mechanic is connected to running a vineyard, so it's thematically sound, but there are a lot of decisions to be made in the game.

However, if the complexity of Vinhos is the minimum level of complexity that piques your interest, Viticulture is definitely not the game for you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm eagerly awaiting my kick-starter copy (any day now!), and the way Jamey describes the complexity is great.
I would of been very disappointed with a complexity as low as ticket to ride, i need some meat on that there bone, and while i do like a good meaty chop such as dominant species or terra mystica etc to chew on, an "inbetweener" is just what i want in my collection right now, something the whole family can play, but has enough to chew on still....or rather sip

Heya!

I've seen many great posts and reviews of Viticulture so far, but haven't really seen the Arboriculture expansion mentioned anywhere, except for the Grande Worker.

So, has anyone tried the expansion yet and how do they like it? Does it add more variability and complexity? How does it change the gameplay? Do you think it enhances the experience or does it make the game too long or create new imbalance issues?

Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I haven't had enough basic game under my belt, yet! But I'm also keen on trying out the expansion board. They just looks fun, and might provide more space for your workers to work on.

Many folks on the other side of the big lake have gotten their games and our games should be on the move too! Amazon.de fulfillment center should've gotten the game yesterday so you, our beer brewing friends in Germany should be receiving your games first.

The point of this thread is to gain some understanding on where the Viticulture carrying trucks are to estimate when rest of the Europe will get their games.

If we get the same treatment as the US customers we should be receiving an email when the order has been shipped.

Don't know how many European backers there are, but post here when you've gotten yours or share the pain of waiting! And Jamey, if you can add any info about our orders please do, I'm dying here!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kristian--We're close, but not there. My shipping company originally said the games would arrive at Amazon.de today. But then today they said that the 20th and 21st are holidays in Germany, so the games won't arrive until Wednesday. Then they need to be processed and shipped.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, thanks for the update! Close indeed... I really hope I won't be getting a tracking number because I'll be glued to computer refreshing the page to see if the package is any closer to Finland....
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I got mine a long time ago, nah nah nah nah nah .

Pfff, and the autograph is coincidentally facing the camera!

Of course it's purely a coincidence, and it's also a coincidence that the wine in the image is from a small vineyard in Tuscany. This image wasn't staged in any way, no sir, not at all .

Hehe Jamey, only yesterday was a holiday in Germany, I'm at the office today, working again
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well I need Amazon to get back on it then!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey! Can we expect them to leave Germany on monday or have they progressed with the orders yet?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kristian--The orders arrived at Amazon.de on Friday, later than I was originally told. I assume Amazon will process the orders on Monday. If they do, I will be able to upload all of the destination addresses, and game should start shipping almost immediately.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yohohohohooohohoo!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wednesday!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How many games were ordered in the EU by the way?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
106 backers...I think about 120 games.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hoah, nice, more than I thought!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can track your order by entering the Sendungsverfolgungs-Nr from the email to dhl.de. After it has left Germany the tracking page will tell you if it has been given from DHL to your own post service. From there on, you'll most likely use the same tracking number.

My shipment is all ready and leaving Germany very soon...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They've arrived!

The box was in bad shape and first time in my life I wanted to open the package in front of the post official. It had a big hole in one corner. I opened the box and for my relief the hole was where there was a lot of paper blocking the empty space.

I checked every copy and they're in perfect shape!

Thanks a lot, I ripped one copy open and oh my... It's...so beautiful... Thank you Jamey! My wife already agreed to play it with me today and hopefully we'll get a wine evening on the weekend with Viticulture to play with 6 players.

I'm in love.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was scared for a minute there, Kristian! I'm glad it's okay.

Although everything is in the rules, I would highly recommend reading the FAQ (http://www.stonemaiergames.com/faq-viticulture/) after reading the rules. It could save you same pain if you're not harvesting or crushing correctly. Have fun!

For some reason I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around the tokens.

Example:
HARVEST:
My field has 2 White & 3 Red grapes in it. I decide to harvest. How do I put those on the crush pad? I suppose I take 2 clear tokens. Putting one on the red "3" and one on the "2" white. What if, due to a previous harvest and aging there is already a token on one of those spots? Do I add them all together (i.e. If there's a token on red "3" and I harvest another red "3" do I put 2 tokens on the same spot, or do I move it up to the "6"?)

Also, when going to crush grapes to make wine:
If I'm making a red wine, but I only want to make it a value "2". I suppose I take the token off the red "3" on the pad, and move it to the cellar "3". Can I then put a new token on the red "1" since I only wanted to use 2 of the 3 grapes?

Again, in the cellar, what if I end up with 2 wines of the same color and same value? Do I just have to remember that, or do I squeeze 2 counters next to each other?

It seems like I'm making this a lot harder than I should, but I want to make sure I'm doing things correctly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the space is already taken, the newly harvested or crushes grapes are demoted one value. So if the red 3 is already occupied, the grape becomes a red 2. If no lower value spot is open you lose the new grape.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, this was a case where I was reading the rules, and then over thinking when it came to playing the game, completely forgetting what I read.

Now I get the whole de-valuation thing.

My other question, stands, however. If I have a token on the red "3" but I only want to make a value "2" red wine, can I still leave the token on the red "1" on the crush pad, since I only used 2 of my 3 grapes? Or does value have a different meaning from number of grapes on the crush pad, and has to become a value 3 wine?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's a value 3 grape, and you can only turn it to value 3 wine. There's no partial crush.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 978921:
My friend and I just played a 2 player game (well, we played for about 90 minutes then abandoned the game, we only had about 5 victory points each). It seems extremely tight, because there is only one spot for each action available each year (e.g. plant 1 vine, build 1 improvement, fill 1 wine order etc). This seems to make it very slow for a 2 player game, where you might not be able to do the action you want in any given year if your opponent gets there first (repeatedly!). And the cards don't help much since the card spots are limited in the same way.

Whereas for a 3 player game, not only are there twice as many spots, and only 50% more players, but there are also bonus spots that double many of the actions.

I think we were playing mostly right (we might have combined grapes to make wines) but it just seemed so slow, and I wondered if we were missing something? We each quickly had 4 workers thanks to a cheap-worker card, but were struggling to find useful places to put them, as we were usually limited by the lack of placement spots we could actually use.

Anyone else had this problem?

Questions:

1. So when you crush grapes (I wish this was called "making wine"), you can only combine grape tokens if you're making blush (1 white + 1 red) or sparkling (1 white + 2 red)? Otherwise 1 grape -> 1 wine, and you can only make 1 (nominated) kind of wine at a time?

2. When you crush, do you have to covert ALL your grapes of the given colour into wine? The rules seem to imply this for red/white wine.

3. The crush expert allows you to make multiple kinds of wine?

4. When you use the yoke, you can only uproot a single vine card? Why would you want to do this?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My first 3 player game was quite slow as well. We've only have a single digit point after 60 minutes of playing time. But this is pretty normal for Viticulture: the early stage is slow, but once people have some wines in their cellar, they can make a lot of point faster.

1. Yes.

2. No, you can choose how many you crush, and how many you save for future use.

3. I don't have the card in front of me now, but IIRC, Yes.

4. Yes. No sure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've only finished a two player game solo (just to learn the rules). The game definitely accelerates towards the end. Despite the "tight" aspect of the 2 player game, neither "player" wasted time. Both "players" sort of leapfrogged over one another several times towards the end. The "winner" hit exactly 20 points on the last worker placement by making an 8 point sale.

After one game my sense is that a winning strategy may be to stock up early on orders cards and then try to taylor your wines to match the easiest to obtain, but highest point orders.

Anyway, like most games the first play or two can go slowly, but with experienced players I can see this game moving quickly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Simon

The trick is to use another strategy than your opponent, that way you don't need to use the same actions as him. There's more than one possible strategy in the game, though in the beginning you might be led by the theme to believe that the there's only one and that's producing lots of wine.

Regards
- Morten
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
True, I've won one game with only one order filled. I get my point by waking up late, giving tours, selling grapes, and lazily planting them. Granted, it's a first play for most of the players (4p), but it's shows that there's other ways to earn points other than making wines.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I haven't played, but I thought that in a 2p, every other round, you would have first choice in spring, and could choose the spot that would give you first choice when placing workers. So wouldn't it be impossible for your opponent to repeatedly take the one action you most want/need?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a future game, is it possible that you wouldn't take as many workers (at any price), and instead spend that action/effort on something more productive? Like I said, I haven't played.

This point is of special interest to me, because I really appreciate worker games where you DON'T have to add as many workers as possible. An example is
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
, where you start with 2 workers and can get as many as 5. I have seen people win without taking any extra. I love that. Contrast with Agricola, where growing your family as much as possible, as fast as possible, is almost always a strong move. Where does Viticulture fit on that spectrum?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kevin--You're correct that in a 2-player game, if both players are going after the same wake-up time, you'll only get it every other year.

Viticulture is all about timing and relation to other players. While I would say it's generally better to have more workers, it may not be better for you to have more workers right away. I would generally say that it doesn't do much good to have all 6 workers, but if all other players are sticking with 3 or 4 workers, 5 or 6 might be a good number for you to target. Thus it really changes from game to game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kevin, I agree with Jamey, it's not necessarily an advantage to go for all the workers, I would say that getting all 6 is often a waste of resources. If I remember correctly I only had 4 workers in my last two games, and I won those.

I must add that I've only played 2 player games and I would guess that more workers are more useful in 3 and 5 player games, because there are more action spaces available per player in such games.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simon--These comments may have been addressed, but I wanted to respond as well.

1. Yes, that is correct. The key is not to crush too often. Let your grapes accumulate a bit so you can maximize the value.

2. It's "any or all"--your choice.

3. Yes.

4. In the second half of the game, you might want to change the configuration of you fields. It's not used often for this purpose, but it's there just in case you need a really strong red or white field. Also, the Yoke is really important in a 2-player game so you can harvest every year.

A 2-player game usually takes about 45 minutes, so I would suggest trying again and testing out various strategies. Also, one variant that I highly recommend is to play with the Grande Worker in the two-player game. That worker lets you get the middle action space bonus without placing a worker there, so it gives you a nice bonus once a year and opens up the two-player game a bit.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks guys, we were just playing a friendly introductory game, so just trying things out, learning, etc. I think we played about 10 years or so, and so it was a bit discouraging to see how difficult it was get an engine going, and to have to abandon the game after 90 mins. We weren't playing particularly slowly or prone to AP.

It reminded me of playing Settlers of Catan, and not in a good way: very slow for 2/3 of the game, then ramps up fast. Nowadays we always play Settlers with the Tournament rules and Welfare variant to keep it moving.

Having more workers wouldn't have helped us, because most of the spots were things we couldn't do (i.e. we didn't have the right cards or other resources to do the actions anyway).

Maybe I'll try the Large Meeple variant. I've got a 6p game scheduled for Wednesday.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I played with 2 players tonight, and the game seemed to go on forever. The bottleneck appears to be planting vines, and if you don't draw grapes with high enough value, you can't get much going. I'll admit it may be our lack of experience, but we ended up with all buildings built, tons of money, very little wine and few orders filled. Toward the end we had to take the first wakeup space every time just to be able to plant at all. I hope I'm misreading something, but if not, it looks like a fix will be needed.

Edit: I just noticed the post about the "Grande Worker". This may be the answer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you remember to age the wine and grapes? You don't really needs a high value grape to make high value wine, just let them ages.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would really recommend playing a few more times, Blake and Simon. It is a tight game, but I've never seen a non-teaching game go over 8 years. There's a learning curve, and there's also a production curve during the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Also, did you guys read the FAQ? You might want to check it out in case you're missing something in the rules. You're leaving the vine cards planted in the field after you harvest, correct?

http://www.stonemaiergames.com/faq-viticulture/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Blake

In 8 games with 2 players I've never had this happen, so my guess is that you have misunderstood a rule. Since you mention wanting to plant all the the most likely candidate is Jamey's suggestion that you're removing the vines from the fields when harvesting instead of letting them stay.

- Morten
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This wasn't our problem, we each both got at least one field planted to a max of 6. We didn't build many improvements: trellis, and 2 cellars mainly, irrigation, a tour bonus one, and later, yoke.

We might have been turning our grapes into wine too fast, to try to fill orders, not letting them age enough.

We did make the mistake that we thought you could combine grapes of a kind to make a wine (e.g. 2 white grapes to make a combined-value white wine). We did this with the aim to have a valuable enough wine to fill an order, but actually this isn't allowed I think. As a result we maybe used our grapes faster than we would have, and we made less quantity of wine.

I can see that harvest is a key step for getting grapes into the crush pad and ageing, even before you have cellars and/or orders, and so building the yoke is almost essential (we didn't do it until late in the part-game).

We also didn't focus much on the non-wine victory point opportunities, but I can see that you could score several each year if you wanted to go that route; over several years this could get you to 20.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, we were removing the planted vines when harvesting. Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just to make sure: They also age as wines in the cellar (if you have the sufficient size cellar), but crushing too often does have the disadvantage of wasting actions that could have been spent better on something else.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, you're right this isn't allowed and it will produce fewer wines.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I see it the same way, having the yoke early is essential if your strategy is focused on producing wine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I did the same thing in the beginning. Given the theme it seems obvious that the winning strategy should be focused on producing and selling wine, but as you note, there are other ways to earn VPs and instead of competing with the other players for scarce action spaces it can be a good strategy to use alternate strategies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simon--I would also recommend that you not always try to max out your fields. I've won games when I've only planted 2 vines the entire time. It depends on the game, but sometimes that can work out if you harvest often and time your crushes well.

Morten has played many, many 2-player games, so you can trust his input.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Having now successfully played a 6p game (in 3.5 hours, including teaching) I think we mostly just underestimated how long the game would take. It does start off quite slow, and it's difficult to get out of the blocks. Once you get a good amount of grapes and wine ageing, it accelerates quickly, as you focus on filling orders. But it seems to take a while to get to that point. The production chain is quite long!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT? We didn't!

But thematically of course it makes sense.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just to add another voice and another warning to future 2 players: My wife and I finally played Viticulture two players last night. Unfortunately, I hadn't read this thread thoroughly and we played just with the base rules.

I really, really didn't like the game at all. I'm not a fan of very tight games, but this wasn't just tight: it was silly back and forth. And if you tried to get cute/strategic and not the your most wanted action right away so you could maximize your second action (for example sneaking it a harvesting before crushing), the action you really want gets taken and you need to wait 2 full more turns before you can take it. So... frustrating...

I did love the 5 player game, so we're going to try it again with the Grande variant that Jamey suggested. I think that will really solve the problem and make it into a really fun experience again.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's only a silly back and forth if you're both using the same strategy. There are other strategies thar are just as viable as the produce wine and fulfill orders strategy. As an example I fulfilled one three VP wine order in my last two player game, and I won it with a margin of six points, and could have won it without fulfilling a single order.

It's unfortunately very common for people to fall into the trap of only seeing one viable strategy in the game (I did so myself initially). If you're interested and want to have fun with two player games, I suggest you read
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
about the issue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I know, I read that thread. Realistically, just about everybody new to the game will try to go for the wine-making strategy, and they'll leave with a bad taste in their mouth (no pun intended).

You may also have been dealt cards that really encourage you to go after a wine-making strategy, so changing paths is a major blow (and you're hoping the other person will).

I wonder how viable other strategies are in a 2-player game though. I know the straight victory point strategy is very viable in a 4-5 player game, but there are lots of cards that are crippled in a 2 player game (every player can do X and if so, you gain 1-2 victory points). I'll definitely try it next time, but I have some doubts how it'll work.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I completely agree that it's an issue with the game that it's so easy to fall into the trap, and I've recommended to Jamey that he includes a strategy section in the next version of the rules, and it's my impression that he's going to do this.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can tell you that I've only played the game with two players (about ten times) and I'd guess that something like half of them have been won using the obvious wine producing strategy - and this includes the initial game where both players focused on producing wine.

Having just backed Euphoria on Kickstarter I found out about Viticulture. I have looked but have not found anywhere what is exclusive to the Kickstarter version and what is included with the preorder of Viticulture on the Stonemaier Games site. Are the only Kickstarter exclusive items the extra crops expansion and the promo cards or is everything on the Viticulture Kickstarter page exclusive? Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim--The list is somewhat lengthy, but it's all on the stretch goal chart on the Viticulture Kickstarter page. Does that help?

http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jameystegmaier/viticultu...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From my read of the KS site, it looks like the Arboriculture expansion is the only thing exclusive to the KS copies. The site says the components that make up the Arboriculture expansion could be packaged with another expansion in the future, but it's not guaranteed.

EDIT - Ninja'd by Jamey.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamey, I guess that is what I was confused about. Are all of those exclusive to the Kickstarter version and the standard version has none of those? I only ask because when I look at the order page on Stonemaier Games for Viticulture I see what appears to be the custom meeples which is what left me confused. Hopefully that makes sense.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim--I apologize for the confusion. You can delineate the two categories (retail and Kickstarter-only) but looking for the words "in each pre-ordered game". If it says that, it means that it's Kickstarter only. So for example, the custom tokens are part of the retail version of the game--no cubes for us at Stonemaier Games.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the clarification Jamey, your responsiveness is outstanding!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My pleasure! I've been glued to the computer monitoring Euphoria all day.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So the pre-order on the stonemaiergames is the retail edition,right？
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nigel--Yes, it is the retail version.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ouch.

Not what I wanted to find out. Yet another game I will not be buying due to not having kickstarter exclusives that add to the game.

Sad day.

Looks like it will just be Euphoria for me. Now to find out what to do with the extra $45.

-Diazaburo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I believe Stonemaier Games might publish the Arboriculture expansion separately in the future and make it available for sale, which is a possibility that has already been highlighted earlier in this thread. Hence, I wouldn't think of it strictly as a KS exclusive, which would mean that it will never be made available to non-KS backers of Viticulture. Hopefully, this helps you to consider getting Viticulture after all. Don't miss out on a wonderful game!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm still confused. Will the retail version include everything listed on the kickstarter page except the expansion?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michelle--The retail version includes everything on the Kickstarter page except the expansion and except for anything on the stretch goal chart marked "in each pre-ordered game."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks...so the complete list is (not included in retail version):

* 4 Promo Cards
* 1 set token stickers
* Scorebook
* Coasters
* Custom Art Print
* Arboriculture expansion
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Kickstarter version also has a sleeve for the box that makes it look like a rustic wine crate.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, thanks...that goal wasn't reached, so I didn't know. What I'm wondering is after the expansion, what will I miss by buying the retail version. Looks like nothing major (token upgrades, etc.).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes it wasn't reached, but I think Jamey likes sleeves so much that he included it anyway .

You'll miss out on the expansion, but other than that I don't see the retail version as missing anything central to the game experience, and in my opinion it plays great without the expansion.

WOOT! I got my email too! I should get it next Wed the 22nd. I'm in Northern CA.

Awesome!! So can't wait!

[edit] It says it's shipping via smartpost... does anyone know what that is? I have a tracking number, but I don't know if that's UPS or USPS.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pretty sure that means UPS/FedEx ships it to you local USPS branch, who will then make final delivery to you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yep, I got a shipping notice today too! Expected delivery is 5/21 in Michigan. For once it's good to live near Pennsylvania. (jk - my wife grew up in lovely PA)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shipping notice received today with an expected arrival date of 5/23. Woot!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I, too, received my notice today. Living in PA, it shows delivery expected on Monday 5/20/13.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm also in Northern California and my package is being sent via Smartpost. Turns out my tracking number resolves in FedEx's system. As another poster mentioned, I think it will pass to other hands, either USPS or another local company, before it reaches me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think Smartpost means that UPS or Fedex will get the package to your local post office, and the post office will deliver it to you via USPS.

Jamey, are preorders going out now as well? (I am one of the JVMF preorders)?

Give each other player 1 card from your hand. Gain 2 lira for each card you give.

I assume that if in a 5 player game you have to have 4 cards in hand to play this and you can't choose to just give 1 player 1 card and only earn 2 lira?

If a visitor card says get X in exchange for 1 VP like uncertified teacher is this one of the ways to go negative or must you have positive VPs to play it?

Mark

You can go negative by playing such a visitor card (though no lower than -5). In Note 1 on page 2 it's written that:

If I have a wine order that requires at least 5 red and at least 3 white can I use a 3 red wine token and a 2 red wine token to fulfil the 5 or must it be a single 5 red wine token?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Mark

It must be a single red wine token of value at least 5. On page 11 of the rulebook it says "a red wine token worth at least...". Note the word "a" (i.e. 1) at the beginning.

This rule could have been phrased clearer, and I'm kicking myself right now because I didn't notice the issue when I proofread the rules during the Kickstarter.

Only two votes for that player count and they're split.

Would love to hear details of what people thought of the 6 player game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would say that the game is slightly better with 5 players, just because you have some extra room to breath. In a 6-player game, you almost definitely need to build the Yoke.

I designed the game, so my answer doesn't really count, but I thought I'd throw in my two cents.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How long does the game take to play at various counts? A lot of games fall down with 6 (or even 5) players because it just starts to take too darned long.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have 6 people who know how to play, 90 minutes max. If any players are learning, probably closer to 2 hours. On each turn you're only placing one worker, so there's little downtime, even in a bigger game.

I saw on the 2013 Geekway "Play and Win" Geeklist that Stonemaier Games will be at Geekway 2013. I was curious if that means you will be actively teaching/demoing Vitticulture or just (generally) there?

I know I'm going to try Vitticulture if possible while I'm there, so I was just curious!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely! We'll definitely be there on Saturday and Sunday, and possibly on Friday too. We'll be demoing Viticulture and the full-art prototype of our new game, Euphoria. Looking forward to seeing you there!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I saw both of these displayed tonight, and they looked awesome! I had never heard of Viticulture, and now I cant wait to try it, and Ill definitely be checking out the kickstarter for Euphoria, because it just looks all kinds of awesome. Great stuff!

Thanks Josh! We'll be back at Geekway all day tomorrow! I had a blast there today.

Suggestion in tuning Viticulture with House rule for gamer's variant for the 3 mentioned problems (card draw luck , card effect unbalance and turn order important):

1.To reduce to draw card luck, , create each face-up open market of 3 cards in each type of draw pile
2.Delete the structure building for Cottage , remove this out of the game (double draw for each fall phase to let you recycle the deck is a bit crazy)
3.Turn order of player number 4 bonus should be : $2 dollars (instead of $1) so that it is suitable in ranking , $1 dollar is so unattractive to keep your turn order behind ,
even player number 3 is stronger in ranking.
4. MAX 25VP security line for VP tiebreaker is very constricted to let money winner coming out for every game ,
If max security line for VP is Max 30VP, this make Viticulture less likely to use tiebreaker in every game as we don want to see
money will be a dominance.

5.optional happy ending: sometimes when a person call end game in a certain year , every player try hard to fill order by using blue card and filling space action,
so at most 3 + 3 actions (filling area & play blue card area) is availble, it is so important for turn order if some players can fill 2 order cards but some cannot fill even one order at the end game year, so at that moment, there is
no limit of space in the AREA OF FILLING ORDER , then it make all players a happy ending with no regret~

6. Expansion of planting Trees (brown card),since draw card luck make apple trees more advantage for making workers happy in degree of happiness track, while raw tomato token or olive token cannot pay for happiness. So we suggest all 3 type of trees (brown cards)should to face-up in 3 pile (6/6/6) and players can choose which type of trees they would like to plant

7. Card effect unbalance:
yellow card of 'Horticulturist ': using tuning of Mr. Jonathan Er ( http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/967474/does-anyone-else-...)

i.e Max 2 Vp for value 4 uproot, but 1 vp for value 3 or below.

blue card of 'Guest speaker' : Max 2 vp even more than 2 players train worker from you

blue card of ' Assessor' : change the effect to get $3 per card you discard in hand, max $6


Lastly,
all these House rules are optional for gamers to polish the game . plz welcome to feed back which you would most likely to apply it~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hmm interesting points, I'm going mull on this because it touches on things we discussed in regards to the second game I played (only played twice).

I agree with your Guest Speaker card comment, in a 5-6 player hand it's way too powerful because once one person takes you up on the offer everyone else feels obliged to follow suit otherwise they are seriously behind in their worker power. Someone commented it is a card that really hinges on that first player saying no.

Hilo ID 967474:
just managed to get in my first play of the game yesterday night

the bits are awesome, the game is pretty good, and its my first Kickstarter that actually came BEFORE the given deadline. color me impressed.


i enjoyed the play of my game and hope to get in more in the coming months. but i have a slight nagging feeling in my mind about the nature of some of the cards

in our game last night, one card in particular was played by myself and my friend ( also my podcast buddy ) and we ended up first and second respectively, with me winning by only 2 or 3 points.

i dont remember the name of the card but it gave you points for uprooting a vein in a field. with the point value being the grape value of the vine.

so i managed to gain 4 points for uprooting my red grape ( value 4 ) vein.
that gave me an early headstart from the rest and i didnt look back ( though i did end up second before the penultimate round )

thinking back, that was and is possibly the easiest way to score points in the game. ever.
plant a vein - 1 action, play a card - 1 action
and that could be anything like 3 or 4 points

but comparing to:

1) wine orders
- require action to fill
- require at least 2 actions to get the wine

2) other cards
- there was one card which gives you 3 points for discarding 2 wines from a medium or large cellar
- another card which gives you 1 point and 1 residual dollar for discarding 1 grape and 1 wine
- also another which gives you 1 point per field with at least one vine ( is also a very good card but takes awhile to attain the max of 3 points. 2 points is pretty easy which well, i wont hate on it yet )



so i am thinking that i dont quite like the ability of the card. i find it slightly too powerful. and thats my only gripe on the game so far

does anyone think or feel the same ?


also, if you do, what variants can you suggest ?

i have 4 trains of thought at the moment

1) cap the point from that card to 2 points ( regardless of vine uprooted )

2) half the point value of the card ( rounded down ) with a minimum of 1 ( so a 3 vine gives you 1 point and the 4 vine is the only one that gives you 2 points )

3) impose a coin value to use the card ( i was initially thinking 2 dollars before i went to sleep, but i woke up thinking 4 or 5 dollars would have been a better limit )

4) leave the card out completely




any thoughts from those who have played the game and have seen the effects of the card on gameplay ?





thanks

sorry for the long post


**edit for bold for easier reading

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just have my second play last night, and I have that card played by another player. We both get to the same score at the end, and I won by having more lira/money. I think it's powerful, but other cards are also good in certain situation. But I'll have to play more time.

I won by utilizing every alternative scoring (6th wake up, selling grapes, giving tours, and planting vine through windmill), I've only complete one order at the very end, which puts me side by side with the second place player.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seems that my wife and I have our faces on a very talked about and controversial card.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can't wait to receive this game!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hi Rob


yes that is the card in question !
hahaha. well, no offense to your "special ability"
:P


hope you get your game soon
its pretty nice IMO
and i'm glad it came way earlier than expected





Jon
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan--Thanks for your post. I do agree that it is a powerful card in the game--in fact, all of the visitor cards are powerful, some moreso at different points in the game. This is a card that's particularly good late in the game when you've harvested all the grapes you need.

Originally the card didn't have the words "discard it," and it was indeed too powerful. You could just replay the vine right after you uproot it. So now you permanently lose something that you took time to plant earlier in the game, and you no longer get production from it.

Keep in mind that getting 4 points out of this card is the best case scenario. I've played many games when I haven't built Irrigation, limiting me to smaller vines that I try to harvest a lot. So if I drew this card in those games, I would probably only get 2 or 3 points.

Thanks for your feedback, though! I hope the game continues to be fun after multiple plays.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I completely agree that the Horticulturist card is way too powerful. It's basically only three actions (draw vine card, plant vine card, play summer card) to get 4 points if you are fortunate in the card draw. Nothing else even comes close. Our first game was absolutely decided by the card last night with somebody using the card in the last round to win by 1. No, I was not the person who got edged out.

Not only did he get the benefit of harvesting 4 value chardonnay for much of the game, but then he scored an additional 4 VPs by playing one card.

I agree that the VP award should be capped at 2.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By my count just the summer visitors can account for about 31 victory points if played properly. The winter visitors account for less direct victory points (about 20 if I remember correctly), but many also allow you to take actions that help fulfill orders. Lately I've been building the cottage every game to try to optimize my visitors. Then hit the bonus visitor spaces for some killer combos.

Are they "swingy"? Heck yes, and I love it!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't forget you also need to build irrigation and have the money as well, so that is at least one if not two extra actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's worth mentioning that the Horticulturist is one of only three cards that will be changed in the second edition, presumably to address concerns like the ones mentioned above. It will now read:

Horticulturist: Plant any 1 vine even if you don’t have the structure(s) required OR uproot and discard 2 vine cards to gain 3 VP.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh dear, I'm not too keen on the change to the handyman card
I'm already having problems with the guest speaker card in a 5 or 6 player game where the card is then worth one quarter of the points required to win the game. With the amended handyman, there will be 2 cards worth one quarter the points required to win the card. Very meh for me

Wished both cards scaled for the number of players in the game

In FAQ

At the end of the year, you gain money equal to your level on the residual payment track.

If I filled some order in last year, and I moved mine wine bottle token up 1 or 2 levels on the residual payment track at the bottom right of the board.

In this year, may I gain the money even I did not filled any order?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. It seems counterintuitive, but that's the way it works.

From the rules (page 11):

"When a player fills a wine order, that player moves his residual token up on the track based on the lira amount on the wine order card. It remains in that position until that player fills another wine order, and then it moves up again. The chart reflects the maximum amount of residual payments a player may receive (£5). (Players receive those payments at the end of each year.)"

From the FAQ:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for answering this question, Morten. Combo, Morten is correct--you receive your residual payments every year at the end of the year regardless of whether or not you filled a wine order that year. The idea is that someone purchased wine from you, but they're paying you for the wine over several years instead of all at once.

Hilo ID 965308:
I played the PnP version of Viticulture several times during the game’s Kickstarter campaign and wrote a
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
of it back then. This session report is a short follow up to that review, because I have now played the final version of the game.

In my review I had a disclaimer informing the reader that I had had some communications with the designer Jamey Stegmaier and thus might be considered biased. Since then I exchanged a few hundred emails with Jamey discussing game design, Kickstarters etc. and I now consider Jamey a friend and have joined The Stonemaier Games advisory board (this involves no financial interest in the company or the game). So while I of course try to be completely honest in my assessment I feel that I need to disclose the above.

While playing the PnP version I of course couldn't judge the component quality. Now that I have the final version of the game I must say that the game looks great. High component quality, the game board is gorgeous and suits the theme very well and every game token is custom made for the game in a shape that indicates what the token is for. The only exception to this is the tokens that represent grapes and wines. These are fine in the regard that they do look a bit like grapes and they are transparent, which is useful because you need to read the player mat they're placed on, but unfortunately they're a bit too large for the space set off on the player mat, so if you have lots of grapes or wines some of them will be pushed a bit off position and it becomes fiddly. There is also one sour grape about the art: One of the Kickstarter pledge levels allowed you to have your portrait incorporated into a card in the game. The problem with this is that in a few cases this have caused modern haircuts and glasses to end up in the art of a game taking place in premodern Tuscany.

After having my advance copy of Viticulture sitting around unused for too long I finally got to play it, when an old friend visited yesterday. We played the game twice just the two of us.

My friend is very prone to analysis paralysis. Actually he’s so prone to it that in our old gaming group his surname is the shouted tauntingly every time someone is taking a long time to make a move . In all fairness part of the reason is that he's simply the most intelligent guy in the group and is capable of thinking more moves ahead and weighing more options in his head than the rest of us. I also had to explain the rules, so I think we spent around four hours playing the two games.

In the first game I was the first player and went for the strategy of focusing of producing wine from the beginning while my friend instead went for the get-lots-of-workers-strategy.

Because of these choices of strategy I got ahead quickly on victory points, but then his superior numbers started to have an effect, and he began to catch up to me. We had an exciting race, where I won the turn before he would have overtaken me.

In the second game my friend was first player and he went for the produce wine fast strategy, so I needed another strategy and went for a strategy of producing very little wine and instead going for alternate VPs such as via the tasting room and the turn order track.

Towards the end I was ahead but was running out of most resources while my friend had built up stockpiles and would soon have been able to fulfill large wine orders by the bucket load. Seeing this I started a desperate end rush with my few remaining resources. The end rush worked out great leaving me basically without wine, grapes or wine orders and I made it to 23 VPs against my friends 17. However had the game gone further than that I would have been standing still rebuilding my resources while my friend would have rushed past me using his large stockpile.

We both had fun. I was reinforced in my initial rating of the game as an 8/10 (corresponding to “very good” on the BGG scale) and it didn't make it worse that the end product looks gorgeous and is up there in art and component quality with the best of the established players (pun intended) in the eurogame business.

My friend also enjoyed the game and he compared it to Puerto Rico, which was one of our absolute favorites back when we had a gaming group going.

We both agreed that Puerto Rico seemed to have a wider range of strategies and counterstrategies, but also that Viticulture has a lower barrier of entry making it easier to play with nongeeks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the session report, or "mini review" as I see it. I am anxious to get this game (in a few weeks!!!!) and can't wait for it. Your comments have reinforced my decision to back this game.

I am really satistify to own this game.
Thank you designer Jamey Stegmaier and Alan Stone
for making such a wonderful theme plug in a twisted mechanism of worker placement

but on the other hand , as a gamer, I know this is a game that hv 3 defects
for us say it is a straight Euro game after 3 play in 4/5/6 player


1.draw card luck----every fall comes , players automatically get a yellow (/blue) visitor card without making any effort, so there exist a big big draw card luck in the mechanism.

2.card effect unbalance--- for example a player get 'novice guide' only making 3 dollars while a 'tour guide' normally have 4 dollars.
This is no reason why we get such different but just a draw card luck~
As well as ....the other card effect that make the VP is cheaper than rate 3:1 (money to VP)

3.Turn order important-----as all we know the starter in spring is always smartly choose to be turn order number One in summer /fall/ winter by placing the rooster in first space,
this is because the turn order is so important in this game
(taking all the first actions in the following seasons in that year is so important , even the bonus cannot be compansate so much for later actions taking )

as a result the turn order every year is jus like clockwise flow because every smart player making the second ,third turn order as they never want to be later~
so the starter pass counter-clockwise is juz like the turn order in other seasons....This rise a phenomenon>
the first player seems to have first action in the first year and because the starter pass
to the right hand side while the spring is going clockwise always, first player still likely to
be the second player in the second year because he easily pick up the rooster in second space after
the starter passing to the right hand side next year. So first player 1 year in turn order number one, 2nd year turn order number 2 and so on,
this is what we do not want to see!!!not really so fair for other play to wait untill a cycle coming up to them in this way....

so is there any good suggestions to modify these 3 defects ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm really interested to hear opinions from other people who have played the game. This could be an example of groupthink, where you all have convinced yourself of something that might not be true. Also, do you find this is more so at certain player counts?

As a minor point, it seems like your #1 is only a problem because of #2. That is, if all the cards were exactly equally balanced, then being able to draw one each year doesn't sound like a problem. So it seems like you have 2 concerns, not 3.

I wonder if you could do some kind of card draft rather than a blind draw.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 963827:
Just played Viticulture this week. Couple of things we missed out / got wrong that might help new players:

1. Worker placement.

- You are not allowed to place on spots with Bonus abilities you can't use, unless all other non-bonus spots are filled up. We played that you couldn't go there at all unless you could use the bonus.

2. Vineyard capacity.

- Easy to miss the 6 point limit.

3. Crush Grapes.

- Mistook the +1 for crushing an additional type of wine instead of adding value to the wine.

4. Filling Wine Orders

- The coin on the cards depicts moving up on the Residual income track. We collected a coin every time we fulfilled an order in addition to the residual income. (wrong!)

Hope this helps. Will update with more info if anything pops up in the next game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 6 of the rules says that the action spaces can be claimed in any order. You cannot claim the bonus only if you are unable to perform it unless it is the only space left.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There's a minor typo there. Must have lost it when I was editing. It should read clearer now.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for pointing these out! These are great additions to the FAQ (which I haven't updated yet, but I will later today):

http://www.stonemaiergames.com/faq-viticulture/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Play my first game on Saturday, miss the 6 point rule, because it's written in the plant section, but not in the action space section. I vaguely remember the 6 point limit, but mistakenly taught my fellow player that you can plant more than 6, but never produces more than 6, which makes the game a little bit weird.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Played for the first time on the weekend. Somehow we missed that vine cards stay on your fields when you harvest them. No wonder the game lasted twice as long as advertised!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just realized that I've been teaching the game wrong, because I've been passing the grape token, ie: the first player token, clockwise. It should be counter-clockwise.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James--Those are two good catches. They make a difference, especially in larger games.

Katherine--Oh yes, that's very important! I always say when I'm teaching the game that it's just like planting vines in real life--they stay in the ground from year to year. All you're doing is plucking grapes from them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh, wow! Very easy to miss! I could barely find it after you pointed it out, even. Thank you!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I still don't know what this means... The most you can harvest from one field is a total of 6?

One I missed (even though it was bold in the rules): don't remove vines after harvesting.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The value of grapes in one field cannot exceed 6.

For instance, if you have Pinot(1 red 1 white) and Chardonnay(4 white) in one field, it's considered full.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ah crap, we missed that too, but that makes more sense, our 2 player game took entirely too long, but this would have sped it up and makes the option of digging up a vine a lot more needed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given the number of players who has a bad experience because they think there's only one viable strategy, I think that it's worth mentioning that you can win this game by doing other things than fulfilling lots of wine orders. More on this topic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That is the way the game was explained to us also. I questioned it (twice I believe), but the owner of the game was adamant that vines were removed when harvesting.

The result was that one player just got the windmill and tasting room, and won the game by taking single victory points here and there. He never even sold a bottle of wine throughout the game. Those of us trying to make points by selling to customers just could not keep up.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm sorry to hear that, Aron. I don't understand why some people think that about the vines--it doesn't make sense thematically or mechanically. My best guess is that people equate the vines with grapes, while really the grapes grow on the vines.

Can you let the owner of the game know so he/she doesn't continue to explain it incorrectly?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamey,

I think the rules are clear but games like this often require you to "harvest" and then remove the cards. Also I know little about growing grapes, so I didn't know the vines stay alive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Kirk. I was actually just listening to a Ludology podcast today that talked about going out of your way in the rules to debunk rules from other games that are different in my games. I wasn't aware of those other games when I wrote the Viticulture rules (in fact, I'm still not quite aware of them--what are the games that have you remove cards when harvesting), but I am aware that it's a common mistake.

I just looked over the rules to see how people are confusing it, but I think we made it really clear--we even bolded the line! It says, "The vines stay planted on the field." on the first paragraph of the harvest section on page 10. Oh well. I'll make it even more bold in the second edition.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I agree the rules are clear, yet I still missed it

Bohnanza is the first game that comes to mind, but I think there are many set collection games that are all about optimizing when you trade the set in for points, money, etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ah, Bohnanza. Good call.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maybe in the second edition you should make that the title of the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Viticulture: The Strategic Game of Winemaking Where Your Vines Stay Planted on Your Fields When You Harvest, Just Like Real Life

It has a nice ring to it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't think that even I could have messed the rules up then!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great thread, although it's worth noting that the above two points only apply to the first edition of the game - the second edition has changed the rules on both of these points.

I'd recommend playing with with the improved and more straight-forward rules of the second edition.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just to provide a counter opinion: I HIGHLY recommend playing the original rules if you prefer a more cutthroat and tense gaming experience.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's interesting. I haven't heard many people support the original rules. I STILL haven't played the game, but it seems like there's near-universal support for the 2nd edition rules.

Part of me has always wondered about that. I mean, it is that the game is BETTER with the revised rules, or is it that Jamey was able to tweak the game to better fit players EXPECTATIONS of the game?

Hmm...

What is the use of the 'single side' post Card (with a crow of people in the background)? and also , how to use the Sticker that provide inside the box?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James--Hey, thanks for this question. Here's the answer I sent out to backers in Asia and Australia last night:

Stickers: There is a sheet of stickers in the box with all of the different icons in the game and different numerical increments. This was a stretch goal that is not actually needed for the game, but after you’ve played the game a number of times, you might want to customize your copy by changing some of the numbers on the cards, board, or player mats. Perhaps you might have a Risk: Legacy-style house rule that allows the winner to change one icon on one of the player mats. The player mats are double sided, so you can always keep one side the same, and the back side could be different (like the different player mats in 7 Wonders).

Art Print: I had my artist create a piece of art that contains every Viticulture Kickstarter backer on it as a way of thanking you all for making this dream a reality.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ooooh! Very cool! (Both the stickers and art print.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for clearing my wonder, and this is really a wonderful and considerable game I have been play this year!

"The sleeves you want are for "Euro mini" cards (the cards are 44x68mm).
They need to be clear on both sides, and you'll need 3 packs of 50 (there are 140 cards in the game)."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Patrick! That is correct. H, I mentioned that and many other details about the game on the latest Kickstarter update: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jameystegmaier/viticultu...

I hope that helps!

Hi Jamey,
Is Viticulture still looking likely for May delivery?,
Will this date apply to Uk delivery also?.
Can't wait to play production copy of this!
Regards
Mark
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
According to the last Kickstarter update from five days ago it seems that the backers in EU should get their games in late May.

Tonight I was lucky enough to get to play an early released copy of
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. A member of our game club has an early released copy of the game. (Thanks Shayne!)

I am a huge fan of worker placement games in general, and this one is no different, in fact it is in a lot of ways superior to many I have played before.

First off, the bits are great! Tons of different shapes for each different building type. I love cool bits, but in a mediocre game they do not save it. Thankfully, this game needs no saving.

The mechanics are pretty easy to understand and logical. The game makes a lot of sense. In the spring you plant fields and have farm tours, in the fall you harvest, make wine, and deliver orders.

One of my issues with many worker placement games is that the "feeding" of workers at the end of each round can begin to feel like a chore. While your goals in this game are determined somewhat by luck (cards) you do feel like you have a lot of control, at least I did.

Our three player game ended 25 points (max), 25 points (max), and 2 points. The third player had less experience with this type of game and waited to long to start to harvest her grapes. I, on the other hand, got a bit lucky that my opponent was not drawing the correct cards for wine orders, so I was able to slip by (won with a tie breaker by having more money.)

So there is luck involved, which some people do not like, but I think as long as the luck element is manageable it can make games more fun, and I felt that the luck in this game was manageable.

You might say that is only because I won, but in reality I do not think so, because at the beginning of the game I was drawing just grapes that made white wines, and just orders for red wine! However, by forcing myself to the front of player order, by taking a penalty in that phase I was able to make moves that helped me catch up.

In the end I could have lost as easily as I won, but all in all I feel that it is a great game! I am looking forward to purchasing it once it is released!

Play it if you get a chance!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm so frustrated I missed this on Kickstarter. Somebody introduced me to Kickstarter literally the day after this closed out. I'm so geeked to get this game. Just bottled a batch of Cab in real life, and I'm ready to start making wine in the game realm as well...without the levels of complexity that would turn my wife off (I'm looking at you Vinhos).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heather--Thanks for posting about my game! I love that two players finished with 25 points (money is the tiebreaker). I feel bad for the player who finished with 2 points--hopefully they'll get the hang of it the next time they play.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Josh--The game should be available at FLGS everywhere (and online) in early June, and you can also pre-order it directly from us at www.stonemaiergames.com. There's a $5 discount if you sign up for our e-newsletter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I felt bad for her too, but she really enjoyed the game and said she wants to play again, and got the order information from Shayne G (who was teaching the game), she focused on building buildings at the beginning and waited too long to start planting vines. But she had a good time!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's good to hear--fun is my highest priority with any game. I admire her for going after an advanced strategy like that her first time playing, but I think she learned the hard way that you can't build ALL of the buildings.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ah, what?! This game isn't about constructing buildings on your farm? No Cathedral, either I suppose. lol.

Really looking forward to this game. The fact that it is so different thmatically than other euros and the the gameplay looks solid. Thanks for the good review of it. It's definitely going to be one we play the day we get, come hell or high water... or work...

May can't get here soon enough!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And so it is with farming in general. It is not a controlled environment and things happen. You could call it luck but it is just reality.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yep it sure is! I have 1,000 tomato plants waiting in my greenhouse to be planted, when last night's frost killed a few dozen of the 100 early ones we put in a month ago...

Hilo ID 955965:
I promised Jamey I wouldn’t make the inevitable comparisons between Viticulture and wine. I know these will be forthcoming in future reviews, such as:
• "A well-balanced blend of strategy, with the aroma of meeples and a note of tannins"
• "Tastes of Agricola, Stone Age and Fresco, with a nose of Puerto Rico"
• "Like your favorite white, but you don’t have to decant! Kidding, you don’t decant whites."

But all of them seemed lame and I promised Jamey I wouldn’t go that route. Jamey who was kind enough to bring his advance copy of Viticulture over to the smallest game night I’ve yet hosted. Jamey who is also probably one of the best at explaining games (we had played Libertalia the same night), and one of the bravest in tackling such a project as making a game about wine production a reality on Kickstarter.Yep, Jamey Stegmaier of Stonemaier games who is a regular in our 2013 gaming group. Woot!

The Box:
Let’s start with the open. Jamey brought over his advance copy - that’s right the FIRST COPY in the UNITED STATES for us to play. Kickstarter backers have been excited about the quality of illustrations, the custom meeples, and the overall production values. You won’t be disappointed - it looks even better in print. The main board that keeps visitor and vintage cards, turn order, and worker placement for each season well-organized is both tidy and artful, reflecting careful consideration. The custom meeples are very cool and the layout of player cards (your own vineyard) add clarity to the vineyard operations. Everything is functional and it looks beautiful. Production was top-notch: playmats, cards and lira are quality stock, and the illustrations add to the feel of 19th century Tuscany. I know some of the other backers personally and it was gratifying to be able to pick them out in caricatures before I read the names at the bottom. Jamey and Alan’s design team really outdid themselves.

One other big pro to the initial design is that Viticulture plays up to 6 right out of the box. That's unusual and wonderful, and it means that any expansion(s) are going to be on substance, not just extra of the same pieces.

The Gameplay:
The fact that Chris (our other friend) and I both beat Jamey in our first game should tell you that this is not a complex game to pick up. Once I realized that we were really mimicking vineyard production in the turn order, it fell into place and turns flowed smoothly. We had the advantage of learning from Jamey, but I can’t think of anything that we had to ask him about that wasn’t in the rule book.

Each turn is one year, broken into seasons:
* In Spring you choose initiative, obtaining no bonus for going first and increasing bonuses the later you go (including instant VPs and extra workers).
* In Summer you can construct buildings, buy or plant vines, sell grapes, give tours and have summer visitors.
* In Fall each player chooses a visitor card (summer visitors help with planting, winter visitors with harvest and ageing).
* In Winter you can harvest fields, crush grapes, store and age grapes, have winter visitors, train new workers and bottle and fill orders.

It’s this last activity - filling orders - that you’re ultimately trying to get to, and you’d have a very difficult time winning without it. Filling orders confers VPs (from a budding reputation) and residual income from wine sales, which gives an ongoing advantage in each new year. All three of us focused on building our wine-making and order-filling capacity, but we approached in different ways. I trained and maxed out on workers rapidly, Jamey attracted visitor bonuses by building a cottage, and Chris collected a variety of grapes for future harvests.

Each of these strategies gave a slightly different feel to the game and it works partly because of the scarcity built into play. The first one to do an action gets a bonus, the last one may not get to do the action at all. In our three-player game there were two slots each for construction, planting, buying vines, etc., so we really had to take divergent routes. So initiative can be make-or-break at the end of the game, but no less vital is having a plan B at all times. I really liked that, unlike some games where scarcity means you sit idle for several turns, in Viticulture you’re not going to be idled if you plan well. If you approach Winter with a visitor card in hand, a field to harvest, or grapes to crush, your workers will be able to do something.

The Strategy:
I spoke to this above. There’s considerable strategy to use here so long as you keep your individual turns flexible. Jamey said that he expected a game to last around 7 years - that’s 7 full sets of seasons, and ours I think was 5 years. The end was extremely close, with Chris at 24, me at 23 and Jamey at 21. Because of the scarcity in actions and the random benefits conferred by visitors, the random nature of grapes drawn and orders taken, I think games will generally be close by the 3rd or 4th turn.

The Seasons aspect is a very clever implementation of role-selection. Even though Spring is really just an initiative auction, the bonuses chosen or forsaken help position a player for the next three seasons. It's intriguing that twice in our game Chris and Jamey jockeyed for the high bonuses, which meant that I could go first but also have my pick of the earlier (and lesser) bonuses.

Summer plays distinctly from Winter, building up capacity versus utilizing it for VP gain. Because workers played in Summer cannot also be played in Winter, you run into a trade-off and I can see a lot of "uh-oh" moments when the first player decides to save his or her workers for Winter only to find that the other players are doing the same.

I may not have emphasized enough that Viticulture is quickly quite competitive. You’re going directly against each other to vie for scarce cards, scarce spots for your workers, even if you’re not directly attacking one another. Actually most of the cards we drew that affected other players did so cooperatively or positively, which was very welcome and I think kept the game positive and competition very friendly.

One thing I want to know in my new games is whether there’s potential for a runaway leader scenario. I hate getting trounced in EVE by the first guy to take a system, or in Settlers by the first one to build a city on ore and brick hexes, or in Race for the Galaxy by a military player with all conquest planets in his hand. I’m really happy with Viticulture on this point because the runaway leader, while not impossible, is going to be difficult to develop because there’s not a dominant action that you can continually play each round to generate a production churn machine. Part of it is that you simply cannot repeat the same action endlessly. Construction helps to a point, you can only plant so many vines, workers are essential but once everyone trains up that advantage is equalized etc., and the scarcity built in to each worker’s action means that you really have to be ready to play 2 or 3 possible actions each season.

Probably the most important bottleneck (no pun intended) from scarcity is in filling orders. In a 3-player game, only 2 orders can be filled each winter, and it’s unlikely that one player will fill both. That limits the possibility of a runaway leader problem since the benefits from filling orders are what will move a player the furthest in a single turn.

Theme and Fun:
I’m putting these together because they’re really inseparable. Most people don’t introduce themselves to strangers with "... and role selection is my favorite mechanism", unless you’re an irredeemable geek like Jamey . Most of us have to throw in "and I really like games with pirates/aliens/wine/ cavemen/Incas/hobbits" just to get a conversation going. Viticulture's primary themes are wine and economics but the secondary theme is that hard-to-fill "I think my wife/girlfriend/cute-girl-from-work will actually play this with me and not feel embarrassed about the aliens/robots/elves" genre. There’s something both entrepreneurial and historic here, and it’s very easy to relate to if you’ve ever been to wine country. That allows for a relaxed gameplay even when its challenging and competitive.

Don’t like wine? It’s still an economic production game. I think it’d be a kick if Stonemaier Games adapted this to scotch or beer as well, but we’ll save that for an expansion (hint).

Verdict:
I’m excited for my copy to arrive and I’m looking forward to future launch events, as well as the planned expansion. Stonemaier’s work here is all-around excellent, Alan and Jamey and their design team pulled off a really top-notch production, a game that’s enjoyable, deep and has high replay value. Thanks to Jamey for giving us the first play, (and, by the way Jamey, do you mind bringing it around for our April meetup so we can try the 6-player?)

If you want to check it out but didn’t get in on Kickstarter, look up Stonemaier Games at Geekway 2 The West in May.

Great review. Looking forward to the game in the future, I missed the kickstarter but pre-ordered through Stonemaier Games. Sadly since had to cancel but hoping to pick it up on this side of the pond when I can.

For those not getting to a con and wanting a copy it's available for pre-order on their website. :-)

Jamey posted an image of the game and the components few days ago and it's been hanging on the Hottest images section on the front page. Keep it up by thumbing the picture!

You can find it here: http://boardgamegeek.com/image/1616720/viticulture

Easy way to get Viticulture some attention before the Kickstarter copies arrive and we'll light the forums on fire!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cheers! I already thumbed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's awesome! I didn't know it was on the front page. I'll check it out.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Me too. I chipped in some geek gold now, don't know if that helps .

Recently moved and am wondering how I change my KS delivery mailing address. Any info is appreciated!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At some point before the games are shipped a survey will be sent to all backers. At that time you will have the opportunity to change your shipping address.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I sent out an e-mail update to all backers a few weeks ago asking for address updates. If your mailing address has changed, please send it directly to me at jamey.stegmaier@gmail.com.

Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Jamey, emailing you now!

...received in email today for Backers, which is listed as being KS only so I'm not going to post it here in full, but I've forwarded a copy onto others in my group buy group.

If you're in a group buy, please hassle your leader for a copy!

Highlights though -
- Shipping expected from end of April to end of May, depending on geographical location (and Europe etc may not be stiffed as in so many other KS)
- Extra bits and pieces chucked into the box for free - for KS backers

Frankly the communication from Jamey on this project, his professionalism and organisation, and the way the game looks and hopefully games do him great credit and other KS projects could learn a massive amount from this chap.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So true, the communication is fantastic, and I'm feeling very happy with Viticulture being my 1st kickstarted game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+1 to communication, will definitely be backing other games that he puts on kickstarter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I saw this game one day after its kickstarter ended

Now I just hope it is out for me to get before my Napa trip in July.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie is setting a pretty high bar in my mind regarding kickstarter. He's making most of the other projects I've backed look bad!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Viticulture was the first Kickstarter I back too and I am most pleased with Jamey's communication and open, honest ways. It is too bad that there aren't more project creators like him, but I can only hope that people will look to his example and try to follow it.

I am so excited to get the game. And to hear that it has more bits is just awesome! The end of April can't get here soon enough!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Viticulture is my first Kickstarted game too and I couldn't be happier. Really happy I backed this one as my first.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just stumbled upon this feed, and I'm really touched by all the nice things you all are saying. It means a lot that you all feel like you're in the loop regarding what's going on with Viticulture--that is exactly what I'm aiming for. I hope you all enjoy exploring everything the game has to offer. And John, after I deliver the game to all Kickstarter backers, you'll have plenty of opportunities to purchase it. In fact, you can pre-order it now if you want, or wait until you hear what people think of it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's Josh not John LOL. I'm on a business trip this week and have been called John so many times...I find it incredibly amusing that even when its written people get it wrong.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry Josh! It's moreso the way comments are set up on here. You can only see the comment you're responding to, so I couldn't see your comment, but I knew it was either John or Josh...I guessed wrong. Sorry about that!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For future reference, if you hit the "QuickQuote" or "QuickReply" button you can respond to any post and still see the whole page.

Can't wait to receive the game Jamey! Looking forward to seeing my wife and I on an actual physical card. We're going to surprise our friends with the card when we play the game with them for the first time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rob--thanks for the tip! I'm using quickreply right here.

Also, funny you should mention your card. I literally just received the advance copy of the game, and guess which card is facing outward on every shrinkwrapped set? I'll e-mail it to you so it doesn't ruin the surprise for anyone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No worries,it happens...maybe as compensation you can put my mug on a card for your next game...

Raise your hand if you thought I was going to ask for a free copy of the game lol.

Just saw this today. The interesting part is that they have an estimated release date of March. I know that May was the 'working' release date, but is this an indication we may have the game in our hands sooner?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I too noticed that. The last Kickstart update from Jamey definitely made it sound like the game was ahead of on schedule! (Edit: see Jamey's post below).

However, I have found that CSI is generally optimistic about release dates (though I don't think it has anything to do with them).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Would be very cool to get it sooner, though I won't hold my breath... though generally, it's not a good idea to hold your breath in any case.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey, I just saw this (thanks Sarah)...I'm not sure where Coolstuffinc is getting their info. The game is on schedule for May delivery to backers. A few backers paid a premium to get advance copies in March, but that's just 4 backers. The game won't even be available by retail until June. I'll straighten this out with Coolstuffinc. Never heard of them until now.

After one reading of the rules I have a question regarding the setup. The rules state that after shuffling the 4 card decks, each player starts (among other things) with 1 Pinot vine card.

How is this possible since the decks are already shuffled?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nice catch . It must be the other way around. I'll fire of a mail to Jamey Stegmaier to see whether there's still time to fix the issue before printing.

I started posting this as a response to modifying starting resources based on turn order. Extra money, cards, what do you do? As I was typing, I realized I was replying to so much more and it could use its own discussion. Finishing this post, I realize it's a bit of a review, session report, strategy discussion and rules/variant suggestion all in one, and it's loooong.

To give a little info, I have played
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4 times now, twice with the crops expansion for play testing. We have discussed the different actions and what strategies you can implement based on your turn order on the first turn. We have come to believe that there is a serious bottleneck at building and planting in the early game. In the first 2 turns, if you cannot build a trellis or get lucky in drawing extra vine cards that don't have a structure requirement, you will be at least a turn behind, and against decent players you won't catch up.

Bottlenecks
If I may, let me walk you through the turn sequence we've had with 4 players. For the first couple turns, players should (IMO) go as early as possible every turn or risk losing pace with other players, taking the empty, $, vine and then whatever for the last choice, probably the season worker or yellow visitor card. Moving to Summer, I've laid our or view to placing workers.

Turn 1, Summer Round 1: We need a trellis in order to plant so the first 2 players will build. Players 3 & 4 can't build or plant unless they got lucky by drawing a vine card during turn order selection at didn't require a building. Let's assume player 3 draws 2x vines to hope getting a non trellis/irrigation vine to plant next round, player 4 takes a tour for the extra $.

T1,S2: players 1 & 2 plant their vines now that they have a trellis. Player 3 was lucky to draw a no prereq vine, but can't plant because the spots are taken. Can't sell grapes, can't play a yellow card, don't need more vines yet, ok, take a tour. Player 4 is basically also forced into drawing a vine or passing.

T1,S3: players 1 & 2 likely to pass so that they can harvest in winter and age their grapes. Players 3 & 4 pass as well since the options still aren't great.

Turn 1, Winter Round 1: Players 1 & 2 are likely to harvest unless they drew a powerful blue card during Fall. Players 2 & 3 can't harvest, crush or fill an order and are left with drawing orders for their non-existent fields or more likely hiring a worker. If they didn't give a vineyard tour, this might be a bad choice as it would leave less $ to build.

T1,W2: Players 1 & 2 are out of workers, players 3 & 4 are still left with hiring and order cards but lets say one of them got to play a blue card for a cheap worker and one of the players likely got the extra worker for the year and may have to hire it out for a $.

Turn 1 results. Players 1 & 2 have started their fields and harvested some low grapes, even if they're only at grade 2. You likely won't fill an order for another turn or two, and they will age along the way. Players 3 & 4 don't have a field, or even a trellis to start one. That is still their #1 priority, but player 4 might get locked out of building AGAIN if the other players get there first, which could happen if player 2 buys something cheap and player 3 buys a trellis. Aside from having a couple extra cards in hand and maybe an extra worker, players 3 & 4 haven't progressed much in their goal of becoming a famous wine maker. Their turn 2 is still focused on what other players did on turn 1 and have moved on to further harvesting and crushing.

Let's assume the worst case scenario for player 4, that players 2 & 3 do build on turn 2 which means player 4 can only plant IF they were lucky enough to get a vine without a building requirement, and even that only makes a single red or white grape, meaning they will want to plant again in the future. Player 1, even going last can focus on touring or playing the yellow card(s) they have drawn, which can be powerful hence furthering the lead on players 3 & 4

Perhaps we're blind to other directions available, but working through alternate options it doesn't seem as lucrative as the most direct route of build trellis, harvest, crush and fill basic orders. That process is simple to progress and doesn't require any luck of the draw or play errors by other players. If you do get lucky and can play cards to still build or harvest when it's been taken, you don't skip a beat and can sometimes even skip a step like the blue card that lets you harvest AND crush simultaneously.

Suggestions to balance first turn advantage?
I would suggest changing the vine cards that are given out at the beginning of the game, whether that is by turn 1's chosen player order or in general. Removing the building requirement to players that are later in turn order could choose to plant with their first worker and block the space from those that built for their's. Does this cause the same issue with only those players being able to harvest on turn 1? Considering they only produced a single red or white grape, I don't think so. Turn 2, the building players will still need to plant, but get a slightly better vine for being delayed. You may say that handing out vines after turn order is chosen make the worker placement very scripted, but isn't it already? Which leads me to the second topic.

Multiple Paths to Victory
What does is mean to you? To me, it means I can do something a bit different then an opponent and still be competitive. This is supposed to be a major selling point for this game. Using games the designers thmselves compare Viticulture to, Stone Age has cards vs buildings for VPs, Agricola has upgrading your house, farming, livestock, cards and more to diversify where you score points.

Viticulture features selling wine and gaining a single VP by having a bad turn order or selling your grapes (which could be worth more if you turned them into wine to fill an order. Oh, and there is sometimes a bonus point for filling an order as well. Let's consider these options from my sample game play. If I can plant and harvest before anyone else, I will be ale to fill orders first for VPs. If I'm not in a position for filling orders,I can instead sell my grapes for a singe VP once each turn, but I lose the VP if someone takes that action first. The game plays until a player reaches 20 points. If I am silly enough to go last every turn for the VP bonus and sell my potential wine each turn, it would take 10 turns to end the game. For the record, aside from our first learning game, no game has lasted 10 turns. Some wine orders are worth 5 points (6 with the bonus) and can sometimes be filled as early as turn 3 or 4. If I used the non-order strategy, I can have at most 6 points and I likely don't have a good setup to do anything more than continue this 2 points a turn strategy, but the wine players should toss out another 3-5 points for 2 of the next 3 turns. There is no end game points for building a fully developed winery or having extra workers, it's filling orders, or well not filling orders. Multiple does not equal 2, with one of which feeling far superior to the other.

**edit: adding this here because its for future readers too**
I want to apologize to Jamey for leaving out the idea that you can also score points for having certain buildings when you take a particular action. There are indeed a couple buildings that award VPs when giving tours or planting vines. This can increase the number of points earned if not focusing in wine production. And I will put my hat in the ring that if we play again, I will attempt to focus more on this tactic over fulfulling orders. These special buildings don't increase the effectiveness of your actions but could offset the idea of taking them more often. The buildings cost a few $ more then others, so giving a tour on the first turn should be a priority to get this started. However, my initial thought of this is that I will still be competing to build and plant on the first couple turns just like before. If I want to build both of these buildings, I will need roughly $8-10.

More mental planning, all hypothetical as my mind churns through my options. Turn 1, I will need to tour for +$3 and can't build because it will have been taken by others. Maybe I get in on turn 2 and build a tasting room which gives a VP for touring. A second worker gives a tour for +3$ and a VP. (Thematic note: I'm not sure what I'm giving a tour of as I haven't planted any grapes yet, and don't have wine for them to taste , but I do say that jokingly) Without the help of cards, it's unlikely that I have enough left to buy a windmill next turn. Back to the touring station on turn 3 as I expect the other spots will be taken. Early game touring is typically full each round as building early is important for everyone so naturally everyone needs money. Turn 3, I tour again and gain a second VP and pray the other players don't build with their first actions and block me from constructing a windmill which rewards me for planting vines. I don't have to harvest them, just put them in some dirt. But oh crap, I still don't have that trellis or irrigation system for the vine card I was given at the start the game, unless I spent an extra worker someplace to get an extra vine or two without a building requirement.

Over the course of the first 4 turns, I've maybe accrued 4-5 VPs which sounds ok if my opponent didn't just drop a 4VP wine order of his own, with possibly more in hand for next turn. Sure, I'm setup to gain 2-3 VPs each turn provided I can give tours and plant without getting blocked as those actions are important to the other strategies as well. This may take 5 or 6 more turns to hit 20VP, which would be a long game of those we've played.

Again, I need to note that this is not what will definitely happen in your game, but it is what I expect with our style of play. Hopefully, this is not accurate and I find this more viable then I'm believing.
**end added content**

I didn't intend to make this a review of the game, but I think its clear where our hearts currently are. We all agreed that Viticulture is more about the theme for wine enthusiasts and not the mechanics for a gamer.

Viticulture is definitely a playable game, but the replayability didn't seem to be there, for us. We found it a bit too simplistic and felt the holes we found to be too much to overcome and want to play it over others in our collection. We also played with the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
which advertises to add complexity, but truthfully only reduced the play time by adding additional points for those that are filling wine orders. The other strategists get an additional hurdle of making your employees happy or lose a VP each turn, mind you that's 50% of your scoring in the above discussion. I had hoped it would add a path to victory, but instead accentuated the obvious one.

On the bright side of things, our foray into being a viticulturist has made me want to finish reading the rules and break open my copy of Vinhos for a comparison.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you very much for your detailed analysis. As a backer, eagerly awaiting the game, I am a bit sceptical now after reading what you have stumbled upon, but I still believe that this will turn out to be a very playable and balanced game!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jon--Thanks so much for playing and writing about my game, Viticulture. There's a lot to respond to here, but let me focus on two fundamental points:

1. The idea that planting early is the best strategy: Planting early is a viable strategy, but there are a number of other paths you can take, most of which involve money. Acquiring lots of money early on enables you to build some of the "power structures" like the tasting room and the windmill, or you can expand the number of workers you have.

2. The idea that there are few paths to victory: There are lots of different ways of acquiring victory points. And sure, wine orders provide the biggest leaps forward--it is, after all, a game about making wine. But the visitor cards provide a huge amount of variation from game to game.

That said, I really appreciate you playing the game multiple times before writing about it. You have an excellent grasp of the game. If you would like to cancel your order, I would be happy to refund your money. You can contact me about that at jamey.stegmaier@gmail.com.

Thanks!
Jamey
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jon--Also, I've been thinking about what you said about the first player, and I think it's important to note that due to the wake-up chart, being the first player to act is a choice. Players aren't forced into being the first or last--they get to choose if they want their workers to wake up early and get no bonus or a poor bonus, or wake up late and go last (hence probably excluding themselves from building that trellis the first year). I think there's a lot of strategy in the wake-up chart, not just from the bonuses, but in terms of determining what you're able to do that year as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamey, thanks for responding. I was curious if you would take the time to read this. I hope I haven't come across as a Viticulture hater. No matter my opinions, I still respect the work to bring your game to life and hope the best of success. I'm also interested to hear other people's strategic thoughts and play experiences.

I do apologize for leaving out buildings as a way to earn VPs, and using the tasting room/windmill as a viable strategy. I have added an excerpt into my original post of its concept as well as my personal thoughts of how it would happen at my gaming table. It was indeed discussed after our games as a method to score points. I do feel that that info is important enough for new readers, and didn't want to hide it in a reply.

You also mention extra workers and visitor cards as alternate strategies. I also found that having too many workers meant taking more actions that were less important to me. In one particular game, we all collected straight workers but ran out of space in the late game as we all had more workers than what we felt were valuable spaces on the board. Maybe this works better with the building strategy as summer spaces offer VPs and we weren't taking them as often in the last few turns. Workers are good to have in a worker placement game, but feeling like I have too many seemed awkward.

Yes, visitor cards also add variety to each game, but I don't personally consider "luck of the draw" a path to victory. The cards can certainly influence how well you do, but starting a game with a plan to play cards to win isn't reasonable. Now I know you didn't say that directly, but it seemed to be implied with your statement and is perhaps just a difference of opinion.

I agree that choosing your turn order is part of choosing a strategy, and I like how Fresco implements this similar mechanic. Our games have been about keeping pace with your opponents and taking actions when you need them most. The bonuses offered for going later was not worth missing out on the actions you want/need. The big difference I see between Fresco and Viticultures here is that Fresco also uses it as a method of catch up. The player in last position is given the opportunity to take priority, even if it is at a higher cost. When the turn marker rolls around to the leading player, they have little reason to take a bonus if it will allow an opponent to take the actions they need the most. Maybe that's not how your games have gone, and we could be oblivious to your design intentions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jon--Thanks for your response. I hope I'm not coming across as too defensive--that's not my intention, especially with such a well-reasoned perspective written by you.

I agree that there's a delicate balance in terms of the number of workers you need, and I see that number changing depending on what your opponents are doing and which cards you've drawn. I understand that drawing the cards has a large luck factor, but I still think they're a big part of the strategy and variation in the game. I feel like that's the case in most Euro games--if you're able to maximize opportunities you're given, even if they don't fit into your game plan, that's an effective strategy in itself. Many of the visitor cards aren't useful right away (or aren't optimized right away), so there is strategy in determining when you play them.

I have a lot of respect for Fresco, and it's probably obvious that its wake up track inspired Viticulture's. I think the key difference is the middle action space bonuses in Viticulture. Sure, the player who chooses to wake up first will get the middle action space that benefits them the most. But the next player still has 5 middle action space bonuses from which to choose since players alternate placing workers one at a time (perhaps you were having each player place all of their workers before the next person could go?) Thus going first might provide a slight advantage if the first person to wake up happens to choose the same middle action space that the next person wanted, but the second (and third and so on) player still has nice bonuses to choose from.

Now, in the two-player game, those bonuses aren't available, but every space is a bonus in itself because no one else can take it after you do.

I've found in the games I've played that going first rarely becomes a top priority until the end of the game. I wonder perhaps that there might be some disconnect in the rules you're using?

I do appreciate your feedback, Jon. It's an honor that you would take the time to prepare and play the game.

Jamey
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wouldn't it be possible to just add another place on the board where all the excessive workers could go for something useful (1 coin/worker f.e.) instead of letting the action forfeit completely? That would "solve" the problem of maybe having too many workers at certain points in the game, and they wouldn't feel that wasted, like you experienced.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marc--There is a space for that (and I'm glad there is--originally there wasn't one!) You can see it if you go here to see the board: http://stonemaiergames.com/

Also, Jon, while I was driving to work today I thought of one other thing. I think the Arboriculture expansion may somewhat solve the issue you describe regarding the first player having the advantage because they can build a trellis and then plant a vine, preventing other players from doing that. With the expansion, you start with an arbor card in hand, and there are no planting requirements for the arbor, so if the first player makes the trellis, the second player can then plant their arbor if that's the strategy they choose.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Isn't the arbor currently most useful for adding its produce to wine orders? Yes planting your arbor before the guy that got to build will slow him from planting a vine, but won't you still need vines to make the arbor useful, putting both players in a wine making strategy? We didn't find a new method to score points in the expansion, outside of having really happy workers. Did we miss something?

Perhaps adding a method of filling apples, tomato sauce and olive oil orders for VPs would be an idea? Becoming an orchard'ist(?) as an alternate path to wine'ing. Also a way to upgrade to larger warehouses to benefit those on the orchard path.

Surprisingly, as I know I have sounded like a hardcore devil's advocate, I do appreciate the back and forth discussion. If/when I play again, I'm sure I'll have a deeper understanding of the methods and tactics you've woven into the design for a richer experience.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a point when too balanced becomes a bland experience because risk /reward becomes non-existent. There should be an advantage to going first and it should be sought after because after all, you're sacrificing wake up track bonuses for that privilege.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jon--The arbor is most useful for that purpose, but planting an arbor the first year will also help you make your workers happier the first year, creating an advantage over the players who can't do that. The other way you can use the raw goods from the arbors is to sell them using the "sell grapes action," which, in the 3-6 player game or using the grande worker, can earn you a bonus VP.

I've enjoyed the discussion too! I really am always looking for ways to make the game better, especially in terms of expansions at this point since we're close to going to the printer with Viticulture and Arboriculture. For example, I like that the grande worker brings the fun of the middle action space bonuses to 2-player games when you add Arboriculture--it makes for an interesting choice. Little things like that can enhance the game.

If you have any other thoughts, feel free to let me know! And SkyZero, I agree with your point about balance. Every choice needs to involve some sort of sacrifice.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think I will prepare a larger reply to this thread when I have a little more time, but I wanted to add a little thought into the mix to see what everyone thought.

Before I had reread the rules and asked Jamey, I thought that the first person to use a worker placement slot had to use the first spot, and therefore not receiving the bonus. Then the patient second person could take the middle slot receiving the bonus. This added a risk/reward of whether to just plunk down first and getting your action done, or to try to risk holding off and fighting with the other player to get the second spot. Narratively this also kinda works. The early bird worker catches the worm, but maybe the happier worker that got to the task later does a better job. maybe??? eh?

Well I have played both ways and will probably leave it up to the different groups I play with whether they want to use this house rule. Looking forward to thoughts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Josh--It's an interesting idea, but here's the issue: It removes the element of choice from the second player (at least for the most part). Let's look at a three-player game under the house rule you present:

First Player: 6 different regular action slots open in the summer, no bonuses

Second Player: 5 different regular action slots open in the summer, 1 bonus action slot available

Sure, if the second player really needs another action space, he can take it. But there's a rather large incentive to take the bonus, particularly when considering the third player. If Player 2 doesn't take the bonus, he then opens up two bonus slots for the third player.

It's an intriguing idea, but I prefer the excitement of having a bunch of good choices available to each player every time they place a worker.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I agree with you and believe the base rules allow of easier learning. I think the base rules create a more ovbvious best choice (at least this is my perception based on the strategies that I have played) which is good for learning how to play and for basic strategies of winning. I think with my house rule it creates more possible negative or inadvertant positive interaction between players (which I know you were steering away from the negative). In your scenario, does player one go for a action that is not his first choice in order to try to get the bonus? Does the second player take the 2nd action and get the bonus only to wait for their next turn again to try to get a different bonus that 3rd and 1st don't play. Maybe I am over thinking it some but it could happen.

Maybe the thing the house rules shake up most would be how people approach the wake up chart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm playing it tonight with 5 other people--I'll keep an eye on it to see.

** Edit 11/21/13: I've had a chance to play several games with the final product now and am updating the review (I originally wrote it based on playtesting with a print and play). The basic gameplay is the same, so I'm leaving that section as is. For Overall Impression and Other Thoughts I'm adding new sections at the end and labeling them to differentiate from the originals (which are left here untouched). **

This is a somewhat long, extremely positive review. Those curious about the possible "criticisms" I had of the game might want to jump to the bottom ("Other thoughts" section).

Gameplay:

The current version of the full rules are available, so I'm going to summarize here. The basic gist is that players will be taking turns placing workers on areas of the board to take actions. There are a limited number of spaces available in each area so you have to prioritize. There is also a bonus for being the first player to place in a particular area (except in the 2 player game), which adds strategy.

Most actions are of drawing a type of card, playing a type of card, or influencing your play area (building things that give you bonuses, converting grapes to wine, hiring extra workers, etc).

The game ends when any player passes 20 victory points. That year finishes and the player with the most points wins (subject to limitations and tie breakers).


The game is divided into seasons and years. Each year follows the following themes/phases:

1) Spring - Determine worker schedules (turn order for the remainder of the year).

Players take turns placing a marker on the turn order track, which will indicate the order in which they place workers for the rest of the year. Players who wish to risk placing later get better rewards, ranging including receiving nothing (to guarantee first), getting a victory point, drawing an extra of a certain type of card, etc.


2) Summer - Preparations and planting.

Players take actions that prepare them for production of their wines, including drawing or planting vine cards, earning extra money (giving vineyard tours or selling grapes) and building supporting structures.


3) Fall - Invite visitors.

Players draw either summer or winter visitor cards, which can be played during the appropriate season to give a variety of bonuses.


4) Winter- Production.

Players harvest fields, crush their grapes to make wine, draw or fill wine orders and hire workers for future years.


5) End of year - Clean up and accounting.

Players age their grapes and wines, collect money for unused workers, reclaim all workers from the board, collect earning from previously filled wine orders and discard down to the seven card hand limit.


The rules are well developed and the game is easy to learn and plays smoothly.


My overall impression: (**original thoughts based on Print and Play**)

Viticulture has become an instant favorite in my group, even with just the p&p prototype. The efforts to keep the game flowing well and keep things balanced without direct "attacks" on other players really pays off. The flow of the game is intuitive and easy to teach new players, and it matches the theme nicely.

Besides the theme and general description, one of the things that really stood out to me when I first noticed the game was the stated goal of scalability. I do have many games that play best with a certain number of people, even though they allow a wide range and thought this was a great concept.

The game is not "exactly the same" as it scales - the two player game feels different and requires some different strategies than a five player game - but it comes close. The general flow of the game is the same and it played extremely well at all levels we tried (2, 3 and 5 player games). This is a great achievement and makes the game an even more valuable addition to the game closet.


Other thoughts:

Being involved in the playtesting phase was very interesting. During our first couple of games we all enjoyed it, but there were some troublesome balancing issues stemming largely from two particular types of visitor cards. One that allowed you to play as many of your remaining workers as you wanted immediately and one that gave you all other visitor cards played that year.

When I gave Jamey feedback I found out they had determined the same thing, and those cards had already been removed (the second has since turned into a much more reasonable version that gives you the top card from each of the four discard piles). This simple tweak greatly improved balance and seeing the way feedback has been incorporated and the extensive testing they are doing themselves really conveys how much they want this game to be as good as it possibly can be.

I really enjoyed the game and am looking forward to playing the final version. But here are some critical points to consider to help you decide if it will be to your particular tastes:

1)There is luck involved. Good strategic choices can minimize this, but the luck of the draw for the cards does influence the game and can force you to change/adapt your strategy. I think it works well but if you only like games where you can plan from the get go this could be sticking point.

2)This is meant to be a light game with a relatively quick playing time (the base game, anyway). I think it has a lot of depth regardless but don't go in expecting a four+ hour strategic epic.

3)Some things seem more imbalanced then they are. This is an interesting one that will go away after a few games, but should be mentioned. There was a general feeling in our group (including from me) that anyone who built a cottage and/or got extra workers very early would have a huge advantage.

Then we talked more about it, and realized that the winners of three of the five games we played did both of these things last out of all players (if at all). This wasn't because luck ran rampant (although it was obviously involved), it's just that those players were doing other useful things in the meantime. So while some things are definitely slightly more useful than others if you can take proper advantage of them, it's all pretty equal and open to different strategies. I just mention it because again, these things appear overpowered at first, and it would be a shame if new players concluded the game is "broken" because someone made good use of them first time out and ran away with the game.

4) Last one. In the 5 and 6 player game the last player (or last two players) in the first round do seem to be at a slight disadvantage because of the lower amount of choices when Spring gets to them and the fact that no matter how many rounds the game goes they will get at most the same number of opportunities as everyone else to choose first. We're thinking of using a house rule to give them a small starting bonus (similar to how Puerto Rico works), such as an extra lira or something.


Again, the above didn't bother me personally, but are just some things to think about. Also, there will be at least on expansion to the game from the get go which will undoubtable add choices and depth.


NEW THOUGHTS ON FINAL PRODUCTION VERSION

My overall impression: (**11/21/13 final production version **)

I enjoyed Viticulture quite a bit while playtesting and was looking forward to playing the final version. If possible I like it even more now. The small balance issues have been fully address and fixed and the production value of the game is amazing. Great themed art on the boards and cards, high quality components and great little touches like an absurd number of individually shaped pieces to represent buildings, etc.

Since printing there have been a couple of rule changes made for simplification or enhanced strategy. One dealt with the way wine is produced from grapes and the other added a "large" worker with special abilities from the coming expansion as a standard element. These changes are now officially part of the base game and will be incorporated into the rules starting in the second printing. Neither is necessary but they accomplish their intended purposes well.

Other thoughts: (**11/21/13 final production version **)

I personally adore this game. But everyone's tastes are different so I'd like to give some critical points to consider to help you decide if it will be to your particular gaming tendencies.

*Points 1 and 2 still apply as is from my thoughts n the print and play and I've simply copied them here.*

1)There is luck involved. Good strategic choices can minimize this, but the luck of the draw for the cards does influence the game and can force you to change/adapt your strategy. I think it works well but if you only like games where you can plan from the get go this could be sticking point.

2)This is meant to be a light game with a relatively quick playing time (the base game, anyway). I think it has a lot of depth regardless but don't go in expecting a four+ hour strategic epic.

3)Some things may seem more imbalanced then they are. This is less of an issue now than it was in playtesting, but during the first few games there are certain strategies and/or early options that might seem to have a distinct advantage. I can state with confidence that they don't. There are a lot of paths to victory in Viticulture and the more we played the more we all realized there is no one element that always gives someone an edge.

Point 4) from my thoughts on the print and play has been fixed (by an ingenious and simple solution that sees the starting player marker moving counter-clockwise in contrast to clockwise rooster placement.

Again, the above didn't bother me personally, but are just some things to think about. Also, there will be expansions to the game from which will undoubtable add choices and depth. I got the first one (Arboriculture) early as part of the Viticulture kickstarter and quite enjoyed it. It fits well and adds layers to the game while feeling distinct and made us want to play the game both with and without it in the future.

---
Overall Viticulture is an excellent worker placement game with a nicely integrated theme. The makers had very specific atmospheric and gameplay related goals that I feel they realized extremely well and to great effect. The final product fully realized the potential of game and this is a fantastic addition to my collection.

So there ya go folks. Jump on it.

Played it and it just didn't meld with my buddies, made us want to play Stone Age or Pillars of the Earth so didn't quite think we needed something that made us want to play a different game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
are they only letting certain people play a pnp version?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aaron--I'm letting all backers play the PnP when all the art is in place. But if people send me a personal request for it, I'm happy to provide it. I just want to know who's playing it at this point.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Did you figure out why you wanted to play Stone Age? Meaning is it deeper, better thematically, more fun or is it just because your gaming group likes different challenges in a game? Do you like Agricola for example or would you rather play Stone Age? Just wanting to understand if your group differs from mine or not!

I'm too scared to try the PnP version as I'm not that big of a game mechanics freak, I like the whole package. Playing a "mock-up" could take me away too. For example, I absolutely love the pigskin dice cup from Stoneage. Also all the wooden resource bits make the game so cool!

What made me luv the idea of Viticulture is that many things are well though. The player limit compeletly hits the spot, we play with 6 players 90% of the time and many games with 4 or 5 player limit get so little play even though they pwn.

The theme is good, I like wine but haven't gone that deep into the process on viticulturing. But I'm interested to learn more through the game. What is important is that the theme doesn't look like it's been just added on top of the game mechanics but that it could actually feel like you're working on your wine. After every game of Stone Age I feel like I've played LONG TIME and then the game just abruptly ends without me achieving anything for my Stone Age village. After a game of Agricola I feel great though as my little farm and family have grown a lot.

The most important factor is the complexity and deepness. My gaming group is casualish. They love Stone Age but I dunno if they would like Agricola because the rules are pretty long to explain. (I would try it but the cards are in english and some people in the group have problems with english.) Stone Age on the other hand doen't have enough viable strategies and ways to play to keep it interesting after many plays. So I'm hoping the game is somewhere in between Stone Age and Agricola to start with and with the Kickstarter expansion it would be just a bit behind Agricola in the deepness and complexity scale.


This is first Kickstarter project that I'm backing up. I started with the $49 pledge but have pledged total of $230 now... And usually I'm REALLY cheap!

So jump on the Kickstarter wagon and let us get the cheese!

Hilo ID 865010:
Viticulture is a fairly light worker placement game, based around the romantic idea of taking over and building up a vineyard in Tuscany. I really enjoy this style of game, so when I came across Viticulture with its attractive theme and beautiful artwork I was certainly intrigued. I contacted Jamey Stegmaier, the game's designer, and asked for a print and play version to try out, which he kindly provided me with.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last night I finally got around to playing it with my good friend Peter, and what follows are our initial impressions based on that single 2 player game between two fairly experienced gamers:

Steve's View

Cards on the table- Agricola is my favourite game, and so this perspective comes from someone who really enjoys quite complex games. However, there is always a space in my collection for something a little lighter and with a lower barrier to entry (something the recent "Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small" achieved masterfully, but that's another story). Note that this is not really a full review, as I don't believe one should review a game without playing it multiple times. However, with the Kickstarter drawing to a close very soon, I thought it was worth getting my thoughts out there, as they differ a little from what I have seen written about the game up until now.

My first impressions of the PnP were that the game art (where available) is absolutely fantastic, and fits the theme of the game perfectly. From looking at the the Kickstarter it seems that the production value of this game is absolutely top notch, and really quite impressive for a first time game publisher. If they are able to follow through on all the various components that they are showing, then this truly will be a beautiful game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After cutting out the boards and cards, and taking components from various other games (workers from Carcassonne, stables and cubes from Agricola, money from 7 Wonders) we were ready to work out how to play. I had already read the rules through (which seem to be pretty well written), and we both got up to speed on exactly how the game worked pretty quickly. I'd guess we spent about 15 minutes on rules reading and explanation. With that we were able to launch into the game, and only needed to check the manual a couple of times during the game for specific clarifications. The only mechanics in the game of any real level of complexity are the rules for harvesting vines, and for crushing grapes into wine- and even these can be very quickly understood. I can echo the thoughts of others that this game is very easy to learn and teach.

The game is structured around the four seasons, with each full year (round) consisting of four seasons (phases):

In Spring players determine when their workers will "wake up", deciding the turn order for the rest of the year. The later the workers wake up, the bigger reward the player will receive, but the later in the turn order that player is likely to go. This is a really nice mechanic, and even worked surprisingly well with only 2 players.

Summer is a worker placement phase, with the various spots being based around activities such as drawing and planting vine cards, building structures and giving vineyard tours. A player may place any number of his workers in this phase, but any he does place will not be available in the later Winter worker placement phase.

Autumn is a short phase in which players simply draw a summer or winter visitor card. These cards can be played in the Summer and Winter phases, and often offer very powerful effects. Many of the cards allow a player to do a stronger version of a regular action, such as harvesting 3 fields (rather than the usual 1), or building a structure at a discount. These cards seem to have a large effect on the course of the game (more on this later).

Finally, Winter is a second worker placement phase, in which the workers who were not placed during summer can perform actions. Winter actions hinge around harvesting vines, crushing grapes into wine, training workers and fulfilling wine orders (a significant source of victory points).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once all the four phases are complete there is some simple housekeeping to perform- workers return home, wine and grapes age (become more valuable), players receive residual payments from previously completed wine orders and must discard down to 7 cards (which seems to result in some important hand management!). The game then continues to another spring phase, with the start player rotating to the next player. The game ends at the end of a year in which a player has exceeded 20 victory points, with the highest score winning the game.

So, what were my impressions after a single game? I enjoyed playing the game- it was light, and the theme is really quite enjoyable. The game was tight, with both of us holding the lead at various points in the game, and it always felt like a competition. The game builds momentum as it proceeds, with about half the VPs coming in the last 25% or so of the game. This means that any early gap can easily by closed by a late surge. Several reviewers before me have highlighted the virtues of the game, and overall it is certainly a pleasant experience. However, I did have a couple of complaints about the game which I have not seen crop up in other comments from users, and so I wanted to highlight these for discussion. Note that since these are based on a single play, it is quite possible that I am way off on some of them. If this is the case then please do correct me, I'd be really interested in hearing alternative perspectives.

Firstly, although I have already praised the theme of the game, there are several thematic inconsistencies which really bothered me. For example, once grapes have been harvested and placed on your crush pad, they will gain in value through ageing for every year they sit there. Now, I am no wine guru but I am pretty sure that this practice would simply result in mouldy grapes rather than fine wine. Additionally, in order to store more valuable bottles of wine a player must invest in a larger cellar, which seems a little odd. While these two mechanics work together to allow strategic decisions (grapes can be harvested and left to age on the crush pad while a larger cellar is built to accommodate the more valuable wine), thematically they just don't work for me. It also seemed odd that a white sparkling wine was produced from a combination of red and white grapes (am I just ignorant about the process?*), and that fulfilling a single wine order results in a payment every year for the rest of the game rather than a single lump sum. While these might not be a problem for everybody, they did slightly hamper my enjoyment of the game.

*It turns out that yes, I am.

Secondly, it felt that there was quite significant "luck of the draw" in the game. It seems to be quite important in the game to find synergy between your vine cards and your wine orders, and at times it can be slightly frustrating when you consistently draw cards which are of little use to you. These cards seem to be those which form the cornerstone of your strategy, but the fact that you draw relatively few of them (maybe 1 or 2 a year maximum) means that there doesn't seem to be a great deal of decision making to be done. The cards either fit with the rest of your hand, or they don't. The strength of the visitor cards also seems to vary wildly, with some offering enormous benefits ("harvest 3 fields", "plant 3 vines", "harvest, crush grapes and fulfill a wine order")** with others appearing to be really quite weak ("build a building spending VPs rather than money", "convert VPs to money"). As such, it felt like the outcome of the game was largely determined by the cards which were drawn, rather than a solid and well planned long term strategy. Now, all of this can be mitigated with good hand management, and a fair bit of cycling (keep drawing cards until the ones you need come up), but I personally found this aspect of the game a little frustrating. This may have been us playing the game badly, but it was the impression this single play left.

**An aside: Much of the game did seem to revolve around a couple of "bottleneck" spots, specifically "plant vine", and "crush grapes". Most other actions in the game can be accomplished in multiple ways (either through use of wake up actions in spring, or through building structures), but these actions are really only available on the action spots or occasional visitor cards. This seemed to have the effect of making those visitor cards extremely powerful.

Overall then, I enjoyed my time with this game, but just wanted to put a more critical perspective spin on it than other reviewers have. I think that many of my complaints are simply a matter of personal taste, and this game will satisfy gamers who are looking for light, non-confrontational worker placement game with a romantic theme.


Peter's View
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well we missed a trick here. Lined up next to our hastily printed and scissored prototype were four bottles of distinctly English real ale. Lovely as they were, it was only five minutes into our first game of Viticulture that Steve suggested we really should have dug out a bottle of wine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh well, beer in hand we embarked on a first play of this prototype of a kickstarter game which appears to be getting strong praise from the online crowd. Of course the plan was to gauge if we might like to back the project from the strength of prototype. (Still this being a prototype, there may well still be changes the designers are playing around with, and not all the cards had their final artwork in the version we played)

A set of meeples (swiped from Carcassone) and a few (Agricola) counters and we soon had the idyllic hills of tuscany in front of us, as well as a vineyard to squabble over. Overall the theme is strong, and there's a few really nice mechanics which fit the vineyard owning setting, the most obvious of these being the yearly cycle to each round which allows you to take wine making actions in summer and winter, and bonuses\cards in spring and autumn. Wine making actions are fairly self obvious and involve things like planting vines, crushing or selling grapes, expanding your vineyard, hiring workers, or hosting tours. Keeping an engine going is fairly crucial, though as the game is light on strategy, the only thing putting pressure on your economy is really how fast other players are moving up the victory track. No bad thing, particularly as you're encouraged to age wine for greater value, but it does mean the game feels a little leisurely at times (no real brain burn or analysis paralysis was felt here).

Strategically, from the first play, I think the game is all about the cards. These are 4 varieties - vines (which are planted to grow grapes) wine orders (merchants to ship to for money and VPs) and then summer and winter actions (some of which are turbo effectively charged versions of standard actions). Essentially if you want to do well you need to line up your hand for a big round. (particularly as most normal actions are limited to only carrying out their effect once - plant\harvest one field, crush one grape type, or sell to one merchant). So when Steve got a Plant 3x fields and harvest 3x fields cards in one round, he leap-frogged back into the game. The game practically encourages hand management - with a mandatory draw card action each year, and another 3 or 4 other chances to grab more, you're awash with cards. The hand limit means choosing to match your vines, merchants and needed actions all within 7 cards is a tricky skill at the best of times.

So a card heavy worker placement game? Well it felt this way - but this does mean your strategy is rarely limited, as there's always a card which can gain you some VPs or allow you to take the vital action an opponent has nabbed first... but still you need that card in your hand, and there's little way to do this than to keep cycling through the appropriate deck.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Of course, drawing cards doesn't feel much like the job of a wine-maker. As strong as the theme is, I'd have been interested to see a few options which pushed our viticulturist role further. Perhaps a 'vine market' in which players can see in advance the types of grapes on offer, allowing at least one area of forward planning, rather than having to trust luck or persistence that your vines match your market. In fact the nifty turn order bidding mechanic (your spring action at the start of each round) could allow you first pick of three or four available grape types, while at the moment choosing turn order is simply another way to grab better bonuses or resources in consolation for letting other go first. (This would have reduced the lucky-dip factor in the cards, which is probably the biggest criticism you could level at the game).

While thinking about pushing the setting, what I'd have loved to have seen as well is a bit more information on the cards about the wine I was growing. Yes it's completely superfluous to the actual game mechanics, but I think I would have embraced the pretence a little more if I was told about the 'strong acid flavours' or 'sweet overtones' of the grape I was planting. After all, isn't wine making meant to be lavish and with a touch of excess? But currently I'm only interested in the numbers on the cards, so adding a nod to the vicarious world of wine making and wine drinking would be very welcome. The setting is strong, but it really could capitalise on its potential.

All in all, a few tweaks on the cards might go a long way, reducing some of the over-powered ones and putting in a few more which give alternative routes through the choke points (planting vines and crushing grapes). But still, I think I could fall in love with this game if it plyed me with a richer merlot-like setting and fizzed a little more with a tantalising glimpse of forward planning, rather than its current offer of a quick trip to the card shaped super-market to blindly grab whatever is on offer this turn.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But of course the real question is, do I think you should back the kickstarter?

Hmmm... well from this prototype, yes. If the game interests you and fills a nice gap in your collection, I think you should. For $35 (£20) it's a lovely little game. However, I'm not sure if I'd pay the retail price - $45 for it, therefore I'd go for the kickstarter before it hits the shelves.

(The slight problem if you're outside of the US is that all of this is before shipping of $20... but then there is also the BGG group buy which totals in at $38 and is well worth a look).

We gotta hit the stretch goal for the new double-sided board art from Beth! Spread the love!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Less than $5k away, let's do it! We're soooooo close!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I doubled my pledge, it's not enough but we're getting there!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm running PR with everyone I know to pledge so I'm hoping we hit it in the next 3 days!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just over $1,500 to go.....sooo close, rally your friends!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think we'll hit this one, no problem. Kicktraq.com projects an ending support level between $56k and $64k, and historically those projections are low because they do not take into account the last minute surge.

Story Realms made about 25% of it's total funding on the last day.

But yes, keep spreading the word!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I always get tense at the end of these campaigns.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just cleared the $55k goal! Can't wait to hit $70k.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission accomplished! $75k here we come!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Awesomeness!

I'm just very scared of the future. My first participation in a Kickstarter campaign has been very intensive. While participating in this I've almost backed so many projects without really reading that much about them compared to the time I spent researching Viticulture before pledging.

I think this may have started an addiction...

Oh yea, I was definitely into it before but now... I check for new projects every night.

hey hey..when can i buy this game at the local game shop..thank!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Around May 2013. Just join the kickstarter and reap all the early adopter benefits!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick--Sky Zero is right (or very close). The game will be released in May 2013, and depending on distributors, hopefully it'll be on the shelves of game stores in June.

Feel free to encourage your FLGS to buy in at the $179 level and let you preorder one of those copies--that way you all will get the game in May, we'll reach more of our stretch goals, you get a discounted price, and the FLGS gets the cut they deserve for being an awesome hub of gaming.

The artwork for the whole game is excellent. It is one of the things that first caught my eye.

I was certainly wowed by it. I have been showing it to my non gamer friends in hopes to garner interest.

Hilo ID 862655:
I much prefer upgraded components, especially the double sided board and mats. You can always buy an expansion separately.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey Fluffy James, here's the thing with the extra expansion: Unlike the other additions, which result in small, manageable increases in cost to me, the cheese expansion is a significant expense. I've run the numbers, and it's only feasible to do it if we raise $75k or more. If we don't reach that goal, I'll definitely be putting out a multi-expansion pack in the future. Thanks!

Overview

Ah, Tuscany. Considered by many the birthplace of the Italian Renaissance where great thinkers and artists would gather. Its landscapes are the subject of countless paintings, poems, and dreams. It is here you find yourself with a dream of your own and a strong desire to make it a reality. With just a little bit of money, dedication, and a head for business, you will work to make your mark. Leveraging the cycles of nature to grow the prefect grape and make the greatest wine, you open your winery doors in hopes that Tuscany will prove to be all that you had dreamed it would be.

Viticulture, by Stonemaier Games, is comprised of 1 game board, 6 Vineyard mats, 42 Vine cards, 36 Wine Order cards, 20 Summer Visitor cards, 20 Winter Visitor cards, 36 Worker meeples (in 6 different colors, 6 per player), 1 Temporary Worker, 60 Grape and Wine tokens, 6 Wake Up tokens (in 6 different colors, one per player), 6 Victory Point tokens (in 6 different colors, one per player), 42 Structure markers, 108 coins (in values of 1 and 5), and 1 First Player marker. As this is a review of the game’s prototype, we will not comment on the game’s production quality.

Game Set Up

To set up the game, first place the game board in the middle of the playing area. The game board should be within easy reach of all the players at all times.

Second, give each player a Vineyard mat. This is placed in front of the owning player.

Third, have each player select a color of their choice and give to them 6 Worker meeples, 1 Wake Up token, and 1 Victory Point token all of the same color. The Workers and Wake Up marker are temporarily set to one side of the player’s Vineyard mat. The Victory Point tokens should be placed on the “start” space of the Victory Point track located at the bottom of the game board. The player’s start with 3 Workers at their disposal.

Fourth, separate and shuffle the Wine Order, Summer Visitor, Winter Visitor, and Vine cards (each deck will have its own color). Once shuffled, deal out to each player 1 Vine and 1 Summer Visitor card. Place the remaining decks, face-down, on their starting spaces located at the top of the game board.

Fifth, place the Temporary Worker, Grape and Wine tokens, Structure markers, and coins to one side of the game board. From the coin pile, give each player 3 coins for a total money value of “3″.

Game set up is now complete and your winery’s doors can be opened to the public! Determine who the first player will be to start the game and begin.

A Quick Tour of the Vineyard

The game is played in two locations. The first is the game board which represents the vineyard and the various buildings it contains. Here, cards are kept, Victory Points are recorded, workers are placed on the summer and winter actions, and the Wake Up chart keeps track of player order during the round.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The second is the individual player’s Vineyard mat which keeps track of what Vine cards the player has planted, the values and quantity of grapes currently available on the player’s crush pad, what wines have been created and currently in storage in the player’s cellar, and what additional structures the player has personally built.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everything else in the game, workers, cards, markers, and tokens, are played either to the game board or to the player’s Vineyard mat. Any pieces not in use are simply kept to the side of the game board if they are used by all the players or to the side of the player’s Vineyard mat if they belong to that specific player.

Growing Vines, Crushing Grapes

Note: The rules of the game are summarized here. For complete details and the most up-to-date rules, see the Kickstarter page.

The game is played in rounds with four seasons (spring, summer, fall, and winter) with each player taking their turn following a strict player order. Player order will shift during the game, but the following steps are always completed in sequential order.

Step 1: Spring

During this season, all the players will place their Wake Up tokens on the Wake Up chart located on the game board. The placement of the tokens is important for two reasons. First, it determines the player order for the round. Second, depending on the “time” the player selects, they will gain a temporary benefit.

The Wake Up chart starts with the number value of “1″ and goes all the way to “7″. Only one Wake Up marker can be on each number value at a time. Starting with the player who has the First Player marker, they place their Wake Up marker on one of the 7 spaces on the Wake Up chart. The next player to do so is the next player going clockwise, followed by the next, and so on until all the players have had a chance to place their Wake Up marker. The numbers represent the player order for the round. They also provide the following benefits:

o Time 1: no bonus
o Time 2: gain 1 coin immediately
o Time 3: draw 1 Vine card immediately
o Time 4: draw 1 Wine Order card immediately
o Time 5: gain 1 Victory Point immediately
o Time 6: acquire the Temporary Worker for this round
o Time 7: draw either a Summer or a Winter Visitor card immediately

Step 2: Summer

In player order (starting with Time 1, then Time 2, and so on), players will now place one of their Workers on the summer actions on the game board. Depending on the number of players in the game, a specific action can be claimed once, twice, or three times, with some action spots providing the player who claims them an additional bonus. Once played, a Worker is “locked” until the end of the round. Additionally, players cannot place their Worker on an action unless that action can be completed. In other words, a player cannot purposely take an action they cannot use just to block another player. If a player should ever pass (choose not to place a Worker), they no longer can place any Workers for this season. Available actions follow and are taken as soon as the player places a Worker on them:

Build One Structure

This action allows the player to build one structure noted on the player’s Vineyard mat. Structures provide the players bonuses and are also required to be built before certain cards can be played. Each structure can only be built once. The player simply pays for the structure they want to build and then places a Structure marker on the appropriate space on their Vineyard mat indicating the structure is now available. Structures include:

o Cottage: allows player to draw one extra Summer or Winter Visitor card in the fall

o Tasting Room: allows players to collect victory points when they select the Give a Vineyard Tour action

o Cellars: allows the player to build the next sized cellar which, in turn, allows the player to store higher valued wines

o Trellis: required to plant some types of vines

o Irrigation: required to plant some types of vines

o Yoke: allows the player to take a special action with their Worker either in the summer (uproot one vine) or the winter (harvest 1 field) season

o Windmill: allows players to collect victory points when they select the Plant One Vine action

Draw One Vine Card

This action allows the player to draw 1 Vine card and add it to their hand.

Plant One Vine

This action allows the player to take one of their Vine cards and place it on one of their fields located on their Vineyard mat. A Vine card cannot be placed unless the required structures are built (noted on the card). Vine cards are either placed in an empty field or they can be stacked on top of another Vine card already in a field as long as the total value of the Vine cards in the field does not exceed “6″. If the player has the Windmill structure built, they also earn 1 Victory Point.

Play One Summer Visitor Card

This action allows the player to play a Summer Visitor card from their hand. The player discards the card and immediately takes the action described.

Give a Vineyard Tour

This action allows the player to collect 2 coins (for a total value of “2″). If the player has the Tasting Room structure built, they also earn 1 Victory Point.

Sell Grapes

This action allows the player to sell one or more Grape tokens for the price indicated on their Vineyard mat. The tokens are removed and the player collects the value in coins.

Uproot One Vine

This action is only available if the player has built the Yoke structure and allows the player to take one Vine card back into their hand they previously planted in their fields.

Hire Out a Worker

Available during both the summer and winter season, a player can hire out one of their Worker meeples to collect 1 coin. There are no limits to the number of Workers that can be placed on this action location.

Step 3: Fall

In player order, each player will now draws 1 Summer Visitor or 1 Winter Visitor card, adding it to their hand. If the player has built the Cottage structure, they can draw one additional visitor card of their choice.

Step 4: Winter

In player order, players will now repeat what they accomplished in Step 2, but using only the winter actions. Same rules and game play apply for this season as they did for summer. Available actions follow and are taken as soon as the player places a Worker on them:

Harvest One Field

This action allows the player to collect all the Vine cards in one field and adjust the values on their crush pads accordingly. The values are noted on the Vine cards and correspond to a specific color. These values are added and the marker is adjusted, adding to the total value. If the crush pad’s current maximum value has been reached, any additional points added to it are lost.

Crush Grapes

This action allows the grapes on the crush pad to be made into a wine of one variety. Once created, the crush pad value is reduced as required and the cellar value is increased indicating a wine has been made and is now in cellar storage. If the cellar’s current maximum value has been reached, any additional points added to it are lost.

Draw One Wine Order Card

This action allows the player to draw 1 Wine Order card and add it to their hand.

Train New Worker

This action allows the player to obtain another Worker meeple at the cost of 4 coins. This new Worker meeple is placed next to the training space on the game board and cannot be used during this round.

Play Winter Visitor Card

This action allows the player to play a Winter Visitor card from their hand. The player discards the card and immediately takes the action described.

Fill One Wine Order

This action allows the player to play a Wine Order card and fulfill its requirements by decreasing the types and number of wines in their cellar. Victory Points are adjusted accordingly, but do not discard the card. Instead, keep it out in front of the player as a reminder for residual payment that will be collected at the end of the year.

Harvest One Field

This action is only available if the player has built the Yoke structure and allows the player the ability to harvest another field as described in the Harvest One Field action above.

Hire Out a Worker

Available during both the summer and winter season, a player can hire out one of their Worker meeples to collect 1 coin. There are no limits to the number of Workers that can be placed on this action location.

Step 5: End of the Year

The round is now over. At the end of each year, the following actions are taken by all the players.

o Age Grape and Wine Tokens: all Grape and Wine tokens on the player’s crush pads and cellar now increase by 1 – this is done by simply sliding the marker to the next highest value, but only if the player has the room

o Return Workers: all workers (including any workers that were trained) are now returned to their owning player – the temporary worker is placed to the side of the game board

o Collect Residual Payments for Fulfilled Orders: any fulfilled Wine Order cards that are out and require additional payment are now completed and discarded

o Discard Down to 7 Cards: all players must discard down to no more than 7 cards in their hand

o Rotate First Player marker: the First Player marker is given to the next player going clockwise

Popping the Cork

The game ends after step 5 if any player has collected 20 or more Victory Points. If there is a tie, it is broken by determining which of the players has the highest valued wine in their cellar. If there is still a tie, it is broken by determining which of the players has the highest valued grapes on their crush pad.

Prediction

When I told people I was going to review a game about winemaking and wine, they were surprised I was going to let my little geeks play it. I had to correct them to ensure they understood that the game was about owning a winery and had nothing to do with drinking alcoholic beverages. No more than The Great Fire of London 1666 requires the players to play with matches and dry kindling. Oddly enough, some were rather disappointed to hear it. The wine drinking, I mean, not the lack of pyrotechnics.

Viticulture appears to be a very straightforward, classically framed Euro-style board game. Meaning, a player will be challenge on two fronts. First, the overwhelming amount of player actions without a clear single-choice that would lead to victory, and second, a complete lack of luck. For the Gamer Geeks who enjoy Euro-style games, this is sure to be a real winner. The games rules also make the game play seem very casual with turns being brisk and the level of concentration required focused on short bursts of activity. This should appeal to the Parent Geeks.

The Child Geeks have a mixed record when it comes to Euro-style games. They are either simply OK with them, broken by them, or hate them. Much of it has to do with the level of difficulty, of course, but also the game’s theme. Take, for example, Fallen City of Karez. My little geek was really rather excited by the game based on its description and theme. The game, however, beat him over the head with complicated choices and long turn sequences. Viticulture reads like an easy game to play and I know my oldest little geek has played more complicated games, but I am not at all certain how he’ll take to the theme. Making wine in Tuscany doesn’t sound like an appealing story from an 8-year-old’s perspective. I guess we’ll just have to see.

Teaching this game will be made easier if you sit down with the players and walk them through a single year (round). By doing so, it should become obvious what a player can and cannot do, as well as the results of choices made in previous seasons at the end of the year. By teaching my 8-year-old the game by playing one round with him, it only took about 1o or so minutes before he was ready to go on his own.

And so, while I reset the board for our first real round of the game, I asked him his thoughts on Viticulture so far.

“Easy turns, not a lot of choices, and I understand how I can use my workers to make points. Yep, I feel I can play this game.” ~ Liam (age 8)

He has come so far from his days of being confused by Candy Land. So proud….(*sniff-sniff*). Let’s play the game and see if it makes for an excellent experience to quaff with friends and family or if it leaves a bitter taste from start to finish.

Final Word

My little geek played the game very well, collected Victory Points like a champ, and was very bored. While Viticulture was easy enough for my oldest little geek to play, it never captured his imagination or interest. Ultimately, it came down to theme. Making wine and running a winery was as about as interesting to him as the prospect of cleaning up his room. Which is to say, not at all. He finished the game, but didn’t agree to play another until we had more people at the table. Again, he played the game very well, and enjoyed the uptick in the Worker placement competition, but the game fell flat a second time. He shrugged it off as a “stuffy adult game” and said no thanks to a third try.

Parent Geeks, being “stuffy adults”, really enjoyed Viticulture. Even the non-gamers had a good time and didn’t have much in the way of difficulty learning how to play. Conversations around the table eventually did turn towards wines and winemaking, but only because it was the subject at hand and what was being played at the table. A player need not know the first thing about wine or even know where Tuscany is to play the game and play it well. By the time the game was over, the Parent Geeks enjoyed themselves and were ready to open up a bottle of wine to celebrate the game’s success.

Gamer Geeks enjoyed the game and were the most excited about how it allowed them to age their grapes and wines for more points. Everything else in the game felt familiar to them and they didn’t have much more to say about it other than it felt like a “classic Euro”. All the Gamer Geeks enjoyed the game and thought it well thought-out, intelligently designed, and best of all, well paced.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My little geek gives me his best “rich and snobby” look as we play the game

Gamer Geeks, this is a solid Euro-style game, complete with worker placement, resource management, and zero luck. There is randomness, however, based on the cards drawn. In many respects, it does little in the way of bringing anything new to the table that seasoned Gamer Geeks have not seen before in Euro-style games. Viticulture is built on the backs of the many games that came before it, taking the best of those games’ features to create a very streamlined and clean game play experience. Perhaps the most worthy game mechanism of note is the way the player can age their grapes and wines. This allows the player to slowing increase their chances of making big points and hold off on selling too early. However, caution must be taken to ensure the game does not end before the player has a chance to sell their goods to the right buyer. Based on your peer groups enjoyment of the game, it is approved for your consumption.

Parent Geeks, this is an easy to teach and easy to learn game. The choices given to the players might seem like a lot to consider, but the breakdown of available actions by season and the lack of any game related force to push a player into making a choice they don’t want to, allows for each player to take their time and consider what would be the logical steps to victory. The way to collect victory points is very clear, but the path to victory is not an easy walk. Players must balance their resources and make choices on when to harvest and create wines based on the cards they are dealt or what they think will be dealt to them in the future. The end result is a game that was found to be accessible and enjoyable by both Parent Geeks with and without much game play experience and by the non-gamers who enjoyed the theme.

Child Geeks, this game was easy enough to play but never captured your test groups imagination or interest. As such, we cannot recommend this game for you. There are other games available on the market that have game mechanisms similar to this one that might provide a theme that is more appealing. We highly encourage you to work with your Parent Geeks to find them. After you have a few of those games under your belt, give Viticulture another try and see if the game play is what draws you in versus the theme. I think you’ll find that most Euro-style games focus very hard on the game play and consider the theme and narrative something of an afterthought.

I rather enjoyed Viticulture and found it to be an excellent game that challenged me but never to a point where I was stuck. I also enjoyed how some of my actions were card driven, which made each player’s objective on the game board different each round. This also gave new players some much-needed direction as they started to reach the game’s halfway mark and still weren’t sure how to proceed. Grow more vines or make more wines? As soon as they started to collect wine buyers who gave out big points, they would turn all their attention to making wine like crazy. When that happened, it became obvious that a player had a good thing going and all the other players started to work as quickly as possible, too. This gave the game an exciting feeling to it as each Worker placement became a step on the racetrack intended to outdistance the other players. It was also nice to play a game where the competition was to the side of you, running the same race, but never an obstacle. The end result was a refreshing game, where an excellent mix of light economics, resource management, and worker placement blended together to create a fun time for my friends and family. I’m looking forward to playing this game again.

If you are feeling peckish for a game that will linger on the taste buds with a slight hint of economic foresight, a robust worker placement at the back of the throat, followed by a mild aftertaste of pleasant resource management, drink a big glass full of Viticulture the next chance you get.

This game was given to Father Geek as a review copy. Father Geek was not paid, bribed, wined, dined, or threatened in vain hopes of influencing this review. Such is the statuesque and legendary integrity of Father Geek.

I am right on the verge of backing this game up and have been tracking it for quite some time. I think this review is going to be the one that ends up costing me a few bucks!

Thank you for taking the time to write this up. As always, you did a nice job.

Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening

I need to preface this and say this is my first ever post to Board Game Geek.

This is less of a review and more of a sharing of our time with the game. I am not critiquing the game in too much detail though I am trying to portray our overall experience of the game. There are two things that are important to me about this write up. I want to properly convey my perspective coming into this game and also to not rehash what other reviews and the rule book has done, teach the game.

History
My table top gaming started with the usual monopoly and grew to collectible card games including Magic the Gathering and Star Wars CCG. Next was losing many games of Risk to my brother. My brother discovered Settlers of Catan, and I showed him Carcassonne. We bought almost all of the expansions and enjoy playing massive games. We now play Dominion, Ascension, and Le Havre regularly. I may be forgetting some but hopefully that shows you my newness to some of the heavier games and my limited exposure to worker placement games.

I was excited when I saw Viticulture on Kickstarter (full disclosure, I quickly pledged for a copy) and was immediately drawn to the theme. I am no wino but I enjoy the occasional red, Sangiovese or Port and was drawn to the nice art. From the video and the updates you can tell Jamey is enthusiastic about his game, and graciously sent me the PnP version. I cut and pasted the game together in just enough time to hold my grand experiment, teach my mother how to play while she was in town. Her game history includes the usual Parker Brothers collection and she has even sat in for a game or two of Settlers. But watch out!, she will get you in Scrabble. I wanted to play and write this up to test how easy the game could be learned. When we sat down to play, I somehow suckered my wife (excellent Carcassonne player) to play as well. So here I was teaching this game to players completely new to the worker placement genre.
Game
The game started slow as I increasingly added the layers of the game to each season. I tried to give general strategies for everyone but my mother jumped to a quick lead. I believe the theme of Viticulture lends itself to the ease of starting the game. It was pretty easy to explain: use workers to plant vines, harvest those vines, crush the grapes and age the wine. But in later years, we all begin to hash out our own strategies. Though my mother continued to lead, she was not picking up good cards and seemed to have more trouble getting Lira. My wife took the strategy of hoarding the Lira and quickly had her irrigation, trellis, and windmill built. I focused on pulling vine cards and getting them in the ground, in hopes to of course fill the wine orders and create that desirable machine for victory points.

Mid game the "competitiveness" began as we continually stepped on each other’s toes by playing workers where others of wanted to be. I had three fields pretty full of vines but kept on being blocked come harvest time. It was time to change my strategy and wake up a little earlier. It is wonderful to analyze during the spring the risk and rewards of rooster placement. My wife and I were quietly over taking my mother in victory points with some modest wine orders placed on my part and my wife utilizing the windmill and tasting room effectively.

I want to pause here and address a concern that another poster had mentioned a few weeks ago about runaway winners. Granted this was the first game and I was helping everyone, I was playing to win. The lead changed multiple times throughout and at least with this experience I am not concerned with runaway winners. Of course I only speak with experience in a 3 player game but you can tell that the game has been play tested extensively. So much so that Jamey had balanced a card a day after we played that would have changed the end.

It seemed at the end game, that money was not as useful as in the beginning. I was aware that my wife had gathered a barrel load of Lira and I thought, "Hm, ok she can have the money then." We were tied at around 15 or so and I had wine orders ready to be filled, including a nice sparkling wine worth 6 victory points. My wife put a worker on the spot for playing a summer visitor card called ‘Broker’ which allowed her to trade 3 Lira for a victory point. She traded in all of her Lira for victory points and shot above the 20 level and eventually maxed at 25 victory points. This card has since been balanced and only allows a player to gain 5 victory points. She later told me that she had been holding onto that card for awhile and had built a fantastic strategy to most effectively use it. I completed my turn by filling wine orders and rested on 24 victory points. I believe I would have won or tied her if the updated card had been in play.

Experience
I hope you can tell after reading my experience of the first play with two new gamers that this game is enjoyable. My mother and wife both agreed that it was fun, though some issues were identified by them. For instance, the length of the game. Our session took 2 and a half hours while the average time listed on the game is 45-90 minutes. Take into consideration that there was a lot of teaching and that there was three players, but after that long we were all exhausted. My wife agreed that she will play again as long as the other players already know how to play so that the length is shortened. My mom agreed to play a 2 player game with me before she leaves.

I had fun. It stretched the parts of my brain just enough while remaining casual in "feel". I particularly enjoyed the low amount of direct aggression while maintaining the satisfaction of stepping on toes and the frustration of being blocked and constantly changing your next step and future plans.

I admit that I don't know where it ranks with complexity of other worker placement games, but as a whole product Jamey and Alan at Stonemaier Games have put together a well thought, enjoyable game that continues to expand as the Kickstarter grows. I know that Viticulture will remain in my stock of games and get better with age.

Update: My mother and I played one more game before she left, a two player game, I won though she had the lead for more than half the game. We both agreed that Viticulture produced an excellent time and we can't wait to share it with my brother. I highly recommend going and visiting the Kickstarter page and at least looking at what there is to offer. I want the cheese expansion!

Please comment on thoughts of this post and also possible suggestions for the next game I should put on my shelf and experience.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you so much for writing this! I really appreciate you playing with different levels of gamers/non-gamers, as I'm hoping this game appeals to both groups. And I'm really glad to hear that all of the games you played were nuanced and close.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for sharing your 2 sessions with us. It's always great fun to introduce a new game successfully to family and friends.

Though I've not played the PnP version yet, I've watched 2 video reviews of the game. With regards to worker placement complexity, I would guess that it's closer to Fresco (with expansions). Not sure if Jamey would agree though!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for your thoughts on the game. How long did the second game take?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I grew up with a family that nick named my brother "game master" because he has always been the only one who knew the rules. So now that we live a few hours apart it is always a delight to bring something new to the table for when we get together. I am so excited to bring this one.

It was an interesting week because my mother was in town to watch my son and somehow I was able to introduce her to two new games, Viticulture and another Kickstarter card game that had just come in Monday, Yams. This week has been a great gaming treat.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh, shoot! I meant to add that too. It was about 60 minutes not counting set up (I had it prepared to play from earlier in the day). It might have been a little less but we were both playing past our bed time.

I have been thinking about what the game would be like longer, maybe ending at 40. It seems as soon as I got a good roll, the game ended.

Or, maybe even if there was an expansion or alternate rule set to provide more narrative about how you are taking over your father's vineyard that has been in a slow decline until his death. His last wish was for his vineyard and the family name back on bottles across Tuscany. But due to drinking a glass of red a day he lived a long time and therefore you are old too and only have a certain number of years to build the name back up....I'm rambling.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would agree that the game has some close ties to Fresco. That and Stone Age.

Josh, I'm intrigued by the idea of expanding the goals of the game (perhaps even beyond victory points) in future expansions. I do think that a game is doing it's job if it feels like it ends "early." But not TOO early.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sounds like a similar experience except my friend whom I finally played it with last night found little interest in it since he felt it to much like Stone Age which is in our collection and that it took far longer than Stone Age. We didn't even finish the game. We both thought it was a bit to slow going in the beginning and tried to figure out how to speed it up. Going to give it another go this week with another friend, but he's never been very up on worker placement so I fear this will end up not on my shelf the more I think it matches to many in my group's and my collection's.

Wish I could get my wife to play but ironically she likes incredibly thinky games (Twilight Struggle) or games with direct conflict (which tends to be a big theme when we get a large group together).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I suppose that it can lead to a "best out of 3" scenario
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 862097:
Just got the backer email about card size and am wondering with the current direction of the smaller cards, what is the board size? Is the PnP board size on Father Geek's review roughly the same as what will currently be printed with the smaller cards? Any info is appreciated!

BTW, card size for me is a big...."meh". I think the smaller cards are the right approach given your overall design. It's something I wish Agricola had as well because I need a cafeteria table to play that thing 5P as it is. I couldn't imagine Viticulture with 6 players and all those cards regular size....it'd be a nightmare!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good question. The board is currently 20x16 (inches). It would expand to about 24x18 with the bigger cards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Less than 50 backers away from double sided player mats...WOO HOO!!!!

Cheese expansion here we come!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I likes teh cheeses.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 861096:
Two quick questions.

1. What is the vineyard mat made if? Card stock, paper?
2. Are the coins cardboard or something else (metal, plastic)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Followup question: Depending on the type of materials that are the answer to the original questions here, how thick/heavy duty are they? I like components that last.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think another 65 backers or so and we'll get the double-sided vineyard mats....LETS GO PEOPLE!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 860621:
Curious to hear how tomatoes, olives and apples came to be in the game. I haven't found much on the expansion and am wondering how it ties into your scoring. Any info is appreciated!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sky Zero--Thanks for your question. I haven't released too much information about the expansion yet, but this summary should help:


Having mastered the craft of running a vineyard, the players decide to enhance their brand by adding olive oil, tomato sauce, and apples to their inventory. Wine is still their primary product, so the players decide to package the new goods with wine orders, thus enhancing the overall value of their vineyards.

With the new arbors (trees), structures, and actions, the workers start to grumble that they’re overworked. Every year their morale dips lower and lower, and eventually the quality of their work results in a blow to each vineyard’s image…unless the players decide to shower workers with gifts of the wine, olive oil, tomato sauce, and apples they’re producing. In fact, some players may be able to increase their worker morale so much that they’ll gain victory points for their generosity!

With the help of the new products, a new “superworker,” and good management styles, players will be back on track in their competition to be the top vineyard in Tuscany.

Kickstart 測試 Viticulture (2013)

放了一個長長的假期，懶惰的自己完全沈醉於假期和遊戲的世界，完全將當初1星期1 review的目標忘記得一乾二淨。雖然過去兩個月有不少遊戲值得和各位分享，但由於本次推介的遊戲仍在Kickstart當中，所以將會優先上載(其他的看我的進度了^^)

首先Viticulture是一隻以紅酒為主題的遊戲，美工以簡約和田園風格為主，起初小弟對此遊戲並無興趣，原因有兩個：

1. 工人放置遊戲市面上太多，除非有極新的創意，否則購買意慾大打折扣。
2. 紅酒遊戲在小弟心中Vinhos的地位是難以代替，因為遊戲完全將紅酒的特點完全表現出來。

所以早早以將此遊戲在Kickstart的行列剔除，但事情的發展往往出人意表。
首先不少討論區都紛紛團購此遊戲，不單止香港，甚至台灣都有不少朋友留意這款遊戲。
起初以為純粹因為價格相宜所致，但當團購數目達十多套，我便開始留意遊隻遊戲。
因為一般新遊戲剛推出除非好像7 wonder 遊類大作才會出現這般現像，更重要是一隻工人放置遊戲。

所以便開始細心留意遊戲的規則，發現作者對此遊戲十分有信心，竟誇下海口說若玩家不滿意大可退款，令我對遊戲的吸引力大大提高。有幸朋友向作者取得PnP 版本，小弟二說不說便參與測試。(由於PnP 版本美工一般，小弟只用BGG圖片作解說)

每位玩家取得工人四個(最多8個)，一張田地卡、一張夏季參觀卡和玩家版圖
玩家版圖上方是3個可供種田的地方，個種田的地方只可種植等級不高於6的田地(例如2級紅酒和4級白酒)
下方是收成和酒窖，每次根據田地的級別總和收取葡萄(例如2塊3級的紅酒田可收取6級的葡萄)，每年葡萄都會上升一級，而左方就是葡萄的價值。
酒窖分三級，首級只可釀紅白酒，次級可釀玫瑰酒，最後一級可釀香檳。後兩者是要將紅白葡萄合拼而成。
最後右方是不同工能建設。

遊戲機制與一般的工人放置大置相同
每回合分四季
春季：
決定遊戲玩家順序，以工人起床時間(左下方)決定先後(與Fresco相似)，順位越後，所得的補償越大。

夏季：
第一次工人放置階段，版圖上黃色的地區有不的地方可放置工人，與一般工人放置遊戲大致相似，先放的玩家可取得獎償(例如抽卡可多抽一張)。
夏季的工人放置主要是建設，例如：建築、種田、帶領遊客(取得金錢)、抽取田地、使用參觀卡。

秋季：
每位玩家可選擇抽取一張參觀卡(分夏季和冬季使用)

冬季：
與夏季相似，先放置的玩家可取得獎償，但要留意的是夏季已放置的工人是不能在冬季使用。
冬季的工人放置主要是收獲，例如：收成、釀酒、抽取酒訂單、完成酒訂單、招請工人、使用參觀卡。

遊戲過程若任何一位玩家取得20分，完成該回合後計分，最高分取勝。

玩後感
遊戲的規則十分簡單，尤其已玩過Vinhos紅酒熟成的機制更容易掌握，因為不會因為過期而腐敗。工人放置的策略亦十分容易掌握，可算是工人放置入門的好遊戲。

話雖如此，但我個人仍認為這隻遊戲值得入手，主要有以下幾點：

1. 6人支援--6P的工人放置遊戲在市面上不多，更重要是遊戲取分的途徑並非只有做單的單一途徑(下文詳述)，絕對適合6人同時進行。

2. 遊戲的壓力--工人放置遊戲大都有不同的機制，但不約而同的是遊戲會為玩家制造不同程度的壓力，例如Agricola要繳交食物，往往因為你選擇錯誤，而做成重大的後果，相反進行這隻遊戲，你即使選擇錯誤，往往可在往後追回。

3. 強絕的參觀卡-- 參觀卡可算是我喜愛這隻遊戲的其中一個原因，參觀卡分夏冬兩種，每張參觀卡都會提供不同的強絕能力，若運用得宜絕對能一擊逆轉，例如有一張參觀卡能讓你將所有工人一次過放置在版圖上。可能不少高階玩家不喜歡這類『破壞遊戲』平均的卡牌，但就昨天測試，即使擁有這類強卡，但面對默默耕耘的玩家仍是不敵，因為這類卡並不會如你所願的出現。其實參觀卡是讓玩家有更多取分路線，例如有卡是用錢換分、用工人換分等等，如何有較使用卡片，絕對是這隻遊戲有趣之處。

4. 價格合宜--作為一隻中度策略遊戲，美工精美、玩家人數更可達6人，但價錢只是同類遊戲如Fresco(4人支援)，現在參加Kickstart更有不同獎償。

Viticulture對於高手玩家來說可能只是一般的作品，但作為市面上題材少有，尤其對Vinhos卻步，又想找一隻紅酒題材遊戲的玩家，絕對不容錯過，若喜歡卡牌組合技的玩家(小弟)，這隻遊戲絕對給你驚喜！

另付Search Goal ，讓大家了解作者的熱心^^

Will there be anything different about the double sided board? I just backed at the $49 level and noticed that's the current stretch goal hit.


If there isn't a difference, is there any chance one side of the board can just be the game board artwork without the card locations at the top and player rules scroll along the side? It'd be great to have the option to play the game on the artwork without all the rules and card queues printed on the board mat.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unless I'm mistaken, that's what backers will be getting on the new side of the board-- artwork only, with spaces for the expansion cards, I believe.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That is correct.

Art with no (or much less text) for when you already KNOW the game well.

Check the updates and comments for confirmation and details.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fantastic! I was hoping that was the case! Now let's hope we hit 650 backers for the double sided player mats
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sky Zero--Sorry, I missed this when you originally posted it. I appreciate Mark and Jason for chiming in. The back of the board won't have the writing on top of the art. It will still have the victory point track, and I honestly was planning on keeping the card slots at the top, but also to remove the key (since it's not needed for experienced players) and add the Arboriculture expansion card slots over there. If I removed all the card slots, there would be nothing in the space at the top of the board. I guess I could enlarge the art to fill that space, but that would just take up extra space on the table because the decks and discard piles are still quite critical to the game. What do you think?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I never considered removal of the text on the board, but I actually like what you're envisioning even more than what I had thought about (just simply increasing the image size for the board). With the added Arboriculture expansion slots replacing the player aid and removal of all the text there's nothing to detract from the immersive experience of playing the game. I think your plans for the board are spot on and thanks for sharing your thoughts with the community!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sky Zero--That's exactly what I was thinking. Although I can't get credit for the idea. Jason and some of the other backers thought of it, and I thought it was really cool, so I worked it into the stretch goals. Thanks for your feedback!

This looks like a game that both my wife and I would love, and the fact that it supposedly scales well from 2-6 players is a big plus! Not only that, but this is a risk-free investment: "If the campaign is successful and you get a copy of the game, but you really don’t like it, you can return your game within a month for your money back. We want you to take a chance on us, so we’ll mitigate that risk via this money-back guarantee." This game is already funded, so it will definitely be printed.

I live in Cambridge Ontario, and if just 1 other person would like to go in on a pledge with me, we could save a decent amount of money. And if 5 people are interested, we could save a lot of cash! If this sounds up your alley, I'll be keeping track of things in the 3rd item of this GeekList:

I've not still played Viticulture, but I've played Vinhos twice in the past. I don't like Vinhos since it't too complex/heavy, it takes too long time to play and to explain and it has almost fixed number of rounds (I don't like this kind of games). But if you like games such as Goa, for example, you'd prefer Vinhos. Alos, author of Vinhos has more than once explicitly said it's aim was just to create an heavy game.

In wine-themed games, I prefer Grand Cru, but be careful: this is one of the best business games ever created, but it's not simple. It can be explained in 10 minutes and it has a linear flow.

I've only read the rules of Viticulture and I like some aspects: it has a linear flow, it's simple to explain, it has many many actions to choose from, end-of-game is triggered by reaching a certain nr of VPs (no fixed nr of rounds). I hope to play at least a print-n-play version soon and being able to be more clear ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Ryan

I've never tried Vinhos, so I can't say anything about that, except that from what I've heard it would seem to heavy for you the preferences you express.

Could you explain to me why you're interested in the two games? From my reading of your preferences neither of the two games would fit your preferences very well? But perhaps I'm misunderstanding what you're writing?

I should hasten to add that it was only because of a coincidence I ended up trying Viticulture. I thought that I had lost most of my interest in worker placement games and Eurogames in general for while (recently I've been playing games like Warhammer Invasion and Dawn of the Zeds, and only games that had a fantasy, sci-fi or horror theme), but it turned out that I found Viticulture rather great even though it didn't fit my current gaming interests regarding mechanics and theme.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hilo ID 852434:
I haven't played Viticulture. But after reading the BGG page, both reviews, and viewing the available gameplay videos, I have a niggling concern about the design choices to not include balancing mechanisms, and to minimize direct player interaction.

I've played a lot of worker placement games, and they are basically efficiency engines. If one player gets the spots he needs in the right order at the right time, his engine will build more efficiently than the other players. Balancing mechanisms require players to weigh a relentless pursuit of building their engine with the escalating costs of the balancing mechanisms. With no penalties, there is no reason to not go all out to build your engine. In the absence of balancing mechanisms, it's up to the players to recognize the leader, and hinder him through direct interaction. Lacking a method to do so usually leads to a runaway leader problem. The player who has the best first few turns can't be stopped, and runs away with the game. The remaining players are just playing out the string.

Can someone who has played Viticulture let me know if they've experienced a game where the player who was in last place after the first few years ended up winning the game? Was there a lot of position changes during the game? Are point gains fairly linear throughout the game, or can you position yourself to get a lot of "surprise" points on the last turn, by making several sales?

Don't get me wrong - this game looks very interesting to me. I love worker placement games, and the theme is perfect for us and another couple with whom we play games. I just hate games with the runaway leader problem, and would like to know if this game has been tested for this issue. Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think that's one of the things I like about Martin Wallace games. The rebalancing effects are there, but usually very subtly worked into the game, whether it's something like the income tracks in
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
or
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
, or the invaders in
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.

At the same time, I like games that reward the leader for the choices they've made throughout the game, as opposed to games that are so random that the last place player (who continually made bad strategic decisions) can randomly move to the front because they drew the killer card rolled double sixes, or something along those lines.

Executive summary

For those who don't want to read a long review I'll start with a short summary.

Viticulture is
- a worker placement Eurogame about building the most successful vineyard in premodern Tuscany
- a victory point race with some interaction, but few options for harassing other players
- currently only exists as prototypes
- in the middle of a Kickstarter campaign (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jameystegmaier/viticultu...)
- suitable for geeks and non-geeks alike
- great fun.

Full disclosure

I recently got back from a trip to Tuscany where among other things I visited a small vineyard and bought some of their wine. Roughly a week after coming back I noticed a Kickstarter campaign (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jameystegmaier/viticultu...) for a game about running a vineyard in Tuscany. This coincidence caught my attention so I got interested and asked to see the rules for the game. One of the game designers, Jamey Stegmaier, made a PDF with the rules available on Kickstarter. The rules were finished, but not illustrated.

While reading the rules I wrote down some suggestions for tweaking the text and sent them to Jamey who was very friendly and open to feedback. I did a couple of extra rounds of minor editing and ended up exchanging quite a few mails with Jamey and a few days ago I got files from him that allowed me to make a prototype of the game.

I write this in order to disclose that by being a bit involved in the project and having communicated with one of the designers, I might be considered biased. I have of course tried to keep this in mind while evaluating the game and will also provide the opinion of my wife with whom I played the game.

Furthermore it's important to note that I've only played four games (all with two players) so far, so my experience with the game is fairly limited. On the other hand I've studied the rules quite closely and since there's very little information available about the game except from what the designers themselves have provided I feel that it's worthwhile to post my impressions. I'll update this post if I get the opportunity to play the game again.

EDIT August 2015: In the spirit of full disclosure I'll add that I'm now part time employed by the publisher of Viticulture, Stonemaier Games.

Gameplay

The rules for Viticulture are available online (https://www.box.com/s/9975b4c7a92f242e3325) so I won't give a detailed walkthrough of them, instead I'll try to give you an idea of how the game plays.

Viticulture is a worker placement Eurogame where the players compete to make the most successful vineyard in premordern Tuscany. The designers state that it's inspired by Fresco and Stone Age. I haven't tried those games, but Viticulture reminds me of Caylus and Puerto Rico though it's less complex than those two.

The goal of the game is to be the first player to score at least 20 victory points. Victory points are mainly awarded for selling wine, but can also be obtained in other ways.

The game is played in turns each of which represents a year and is divided into four seasons.

The first season (spring) is mainly a bookkeeping phase where wine and grapes are aged thus increasing their value and income is generated for wine orders fulfilled during previous years. Furthermore the players determine the play order for the rest of the year by each placing a token on a scale from 1 to 7. The numbers determines the player order (lower numbers goes first), but the higher numbers give increasingly better bonuses, such as an extra card or a victory point.

After spring comes summer where the players take turns to place one worker in the order determined during spring. Workers are placed in one of six activity areas each giving the player an action such as planting a vine, drawing a card or building a new structure (there are seven, each of which gives different benefits). At each of the six activity areas there are spaces for one worker per 2 players in the game.

During fall each player draws a visitor card with a choice of either a summer or a winter visitor. These visitor cards can be played during the corresponding season giving certain benefits such as an engineer that allows the player to build a structure at a discount.

Finally winter is a worker placement phase like summer with six activity areas available each giving the player an action such as harvesting grapes, crushing harvested grapes to produce wine (red, white, blush or sparkling) or selling wine to fulfill a wine order card drawn previously in the game by discarding wines of the type and at least the age specified on the card. Fulfilling wine orders give victory points and a small stream of money for the rest of the game.

The game continues year after year until one player has at least 20 victory points. When that happens the year is played to the end and the player with the most victory points wins (in case of ties there are some tiebreaker rules).

Finally it should be noted that the rules were changed while I played the game (a rule was moved from the expansion to the main game). I’ll post an update when I’ve had a chance to consider the change.

Components and pricing

Since the game hasn't been produced yet and some of the artwork isn't finished yet it's not possible to give a final verdict on the components, however so far the artwork seems splendid and I'm especially fond of the image making up the main part of the game board. It looks good and really suits the theme of the game.

What I can comment on, however, is that the amount of components seem quite fair, even generous compared to the price: 118 cards, 1 game board, 6 player mats, 61 wooden tokens, 150 punchboard markers, 60 clear acrylic tokens and one token of unspecified material.

The price for this during the Kickstarter campaign is $39 and the component quality will be upgraded if stretch goals are met. You should add shipping costs ranging from free to $20 depending on where you live. There's also a $10 Kickstarter expansion of which few details are publically available, but I'm sure that Jamey is willing to tell more if asked.

The photo below shows my prototype of the game. Components are scavenged from Carcassonne and Targui with some standard playing cards and sleeves thrown in to stabilize the printed out cards. There are fewer components in the picture than will be included in the final game. The main game board is an A4 print out that's too small, I hope to make a larger laminated version soon.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setup, teardown and playtime

Setting up and packing the game away should in total take less than 5 minutes, which in my opinion is more than fine when compared to the playtime.

The rulebook lists the playtime as 45-60 minutes. The first game we played took roughly 2 hours where I explained the rules as we went along. The next two games took around 1 hour 15 minutes, and the fourth roughly 1 hour. This time includes our young son needing our attention every once in a while.

I would guess that the playtime will scale almost linearly with the number of players, which leads me too...

Scalability

The game can be played with 2 to 6 players and the designers have attempted to make the game scalable by making the number of spaces at each activity area dependent on the number of players - there's one space at each activity area for every two players. Thus the number of spaces available per player does vary a bit.

Furthermore when playing with more 3 or more players you get a bonus for placing the first worker at each of the activity areas, thus a 2 player game will differ from a game with 3-6 players in this regard.

Not having played with more than 2 players I can only guess as to how the game works with more players. I foresee no problems with up to 4 players, but I think that turns might start to drag with 6 players.

Hostility

This game is intentionally designed so that player's can't be to hostile towards each other. However you can mess with the other player by putting a worker at exactly that space that the other player really needed. I think that this is more pronounced when playing with only two players.

Interaction

As mentioned you're fairly limited in your options to mess with the other players and there's no trading between players, so in these regards the game is low on interaction. On the other hand the placement of workers on the limited number of activity area spaces and the play order chart does offer interaction. Describing the game as 2-6 simultaneous solitaire games with a victory point race added would be wrong, but not without a kernel of truth.

Discussion

There’s a great sense of development through the game because your goals and strategy shifts as the turns go by. The beginning, midgame and final victory point rush all feel different.

Having played only 4 games I don’t have a full grasp of the strategies yet, but it seems that there are several possible winning strategies and more importantly you have meaningful choices to make almost all the time, which in my opinion is the hallmark of good game design. The quality of the game design was also apparent in the fact that while there’s always something to think about analysis paralysis was never a problem.

On the negative side the game may become repetitive after a large number of games, but according to the designers the expansion available to Kickstarter should add quite a bit of replayability. I have no way of knowing whether this is true or not since I haven't seen the expansion.

In general the rules seem tight, well thought out and easy to follow, however I think that they could give room to runaway leader syndrome since there's no real checks in place to stop a successful player, but on the other hand there’s also no single mechanism that gives huge advantages, for example 5 workers aren’t even close to 25% better than 4 workers. Furthermore all 4 games I’ve played have been tense more or less to the very end.

The artwork and the game mechanics meshes very well with the theme of the game and together creates a great atmosphere, though a few mechanics (such as grapes increasing in value instead of going bad when laying on the crush pad for several years) does jar a little, when considered from a real life vineyard perspective.

The verdict

The most important question is: Did we have fun? The answer to that question is a resounding yes. The game felt tense and exiting throughout.

Quality of the rules: High. (A few things could be clarified a bit. I’ll write to Jamey Stegmaier about that. So far he’s been very willing to tweak the text in the rulebook.)
Need to consult the rules during gameplay: Low.
Luck factor: Low to medium. (There are random card draws, and while some cards are better than others we didn’t have problems with overpowered cards.)
Suitability for non-geeks: High. (The complexity, playtime, setup/teardown and interplayer hostility are all at a level where non-geeks shouldn't be scared away, though new players will probably lose their first game and compared to Monopoly it'll seem complicated.)
Can be explained to non-geeks in this many minutes: 10. (I would recommend just starting to play and explain as you go along.)
Rating: A conservative 8/10. (More plays are needed to be sure what the exact rating should be.)

At the end of the day the reaction of my wife who’s only a very casual gamer says it all: After each game she asked to play again and while I was writing this review she asked a couple of times whether I was done, so that we could play again.

Feedback wanted

Since this is my first review and since English is not my native language I would really appreciate feedback on everything from spelling mistakes to the content and structure of the review.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your English is more than fine, and your review seems more than fair.

I like critique as much as praise, and you seem to balance both well.

I'm biased as I'm both backing this game on KickStarter as well as looking very much forward to it!

Enjoyed the review!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Morten--Thank you so much for taking the time to review Viticulture. Your review is very fair and balanced--I really like the way you broke down the various sections, as well as the "suitability for non-geeks" mention.

You also mentioned something that's really important to me when playing a game that I've completely forgotten when promoting the game: setup time.

Also, as for the lack of hostility (which is REALLY important to me), the one little structure I just decided to move from the expansion to the main game should reduce the possibility of hostility even more. Although I want interaction and competition between players, I don't want want to allow for spite to play a role in the game. As a game designer, you can't control how players feel towards one another, but you can control their ability to express any negative emotions through the game.

Thanks Morten!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
English is great; couldn't even tell it was not your native language.
Content and structure were also great. Sometimes I find reviews can be too brief, or others go on for too long, but yours was just right and I like how it was structured. I'll keep my eye out for more of your reviews!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Jason and JohnnyDollar: Thanks for the feedback - I really appreciate it .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Jamey: Yes, the "suitability for non-geeks" is a factor that I find very useful to see discussed in a review, and setup time is (among other things) important in that regard.

The hostility element is also very important for many non-geeks, though a lot of geeks probably feel the opposite way about this, so it's a fine line you'll have to tread.

I'll post an update to the review when I've had the chance to consider the game change you've made - though when that'll be I don't know since I'm going to Norway on business for a couple of days.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your writing style was superb. Better than most of us native speakers.

I am a bit impartial as I have already backed the product, as well as increased my backing =P

I find as a gaming couple, we end up trying to teach games to other couples. With the room for 6 players total, minimal cut-throat mechanics, but lots of room for strategic planning, and appealing artwork I am greatly excited for this game.

Also being I am a HUGE worker placement fan tends to help as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah the 6-player capacity is relatively unusual for euros, usually they wait for the 1st expansion to add that
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for the kind words

And yes, I think is a great game for couples for the reasons you outline.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A small update: My wife and I played three more games yesterday (for a total of seven) and we're still really enjoying the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Awesome review, your English would put many native speakers to shame

Cameron
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for the kind words, that great to hear .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I finally had the chance to plat the finished game yesterday. I played it twice with an old friend, so that I now total 8 2-player games with two different opponents. If you're interested you can read my
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. The executive summary is that I think that my initial verdict was correct and that the art and components are great.

Early Access Review (PnP via Kickstarter)
By Dan Martin

DISCLAIMER: This review is based on the pre-release version of the game. Several things are subject to change, including the rulebook.

This weekend I was given the opportunity to playtest the Print and Play (PnP) version of the upcoming board game, Viticulture, a Kickstarter project by Stonemaier Games. Upon posting this review I played the game twice with four people.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Viticulture is a resource management and worker placement game that involves trying to setup the most efficient vineyard, while trying to edge out your opponents.

So let’s talk rules

I’ve played a lot of table top games over the years and have seen all sorts of bulky rules sets that require several reads to make sense of. While Viticulture does not quite fall into that category, the rulebook is kind of clunky. I had to read over several of the rules multiple times the first time we attempted to play in order to make sense of things. None of us playing the first time were able to fully understand what was going on until we actually started playing. A side effect of learning while playing, was a prolonged game that took 3 hours. It would be nice if the rule set was conveyed more clearly. What seemed to be most helpful was the rules video on Kickstarter.

Once we knew what was going on, the game was easy to teach verbally to a new comer when we played round 2! Somehow there needs to be a way to put the simplicity of verbal explanation down onto paper.

Learning Curve: 6/10
Rules Simplicity: 7/10

Setup

I do not think I can fairly evaluate the setup since the preview involved tons of printing and cutting out game elements. Plus I had to raid other games for pieces!

With that aside, though I would say the setup was fair straight forward, and I believe it will be much easier out of the box. Comparatively to other games, the setup is very quick and easy. There is little to do, aside from passing out the allotted starting material to each player.

Ease of Setup: 9/10

Mechanic

I believe the game mechanic is where Viticulture truly shines. In theory you could play Viticulture alone since the game involves building up your vineyard from the ground floor up to full wine production. What I enjoyed about the mechanic, which relies heavily on turn order, worker placement, and managing your hand, is the competitive nature of it.

A huge part of the game involves determining who will place their workers first. Our group found this part critical since going first often offers a huge advantage, but the rewards of going later often can help greatly. Sometimes one of us would get frustrated because we wanted to take action “x” but all the allotted slots for that action were full so we couldn’t. All of a sudden the tables would turn when it was your turn to go first and had the chance to fill up certain actions, which blocks your opponents from using them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I really enjoyed the soil to wine mechanic the game built in, which makes it truly unique. Over the course of turns (years) and during different phases (seasons) players have the opportunity to take actions to build up their fields and ultimately make wine. First you have to plant your vines in 1 of 3 fields, harvest the grapes, crush the grapes into wine, age your grapes, and finally fill a wine order. The progression from vine to a filled wine order really makes you feel good about yourself when you finally fill one.

Mechanic: 9/10

Replayability & the Fun Factor

I’m actually excited to talk about this section because of the diverse group I tested the game with. I tested the game with males/females, tabletopers/nontabletopers, wine drinkers/nondrinkers. The conclusion at the end of both play sessions was clear, let’s play again!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Viticulture seems to cultivate a good-natured competition. The game is more laid back than some of its competitors, yet being able to edge someone out on an action or a victory point, just made the game much more fun for us. It’s speculative now, but I would like to say the replayability is fairly high and the game is highly accessible to a large audience!

Fun factor: 8/10
Replayability: 8/10

Theme

I’m not actually going to rate this section, but wine is a fairly unique theme for a boardgame. I personally enjoy wine a lot so it was a happy surprise to see this game on Kickstarter. The wine theme is carried out well and fairly accurately (aside from some small changes for gameplay reasons, e.g. they don’t grow much white wine in Italy). I also could see some educational value in the game for non-winedrinkers to learn more about the industry, and I would recommend the game to pretty much anyone over the age of 13.

Overall Impressions

I love Viticulture on a wine appreciation level and on a board game level. I do not think there is much of a question here if you are wondering if you should back the project. If you enjoy tabletop games like Catan with a strategic placement element, Viticulture is for you. If you are one who enjoys wine, Viticulture would make the perfect addition for any wine and cheese night!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall, I loved the mechanic and had fun playing the game. The main fault I have with the game is the rule set. The rules ARE SIMPLE, but the rule set is not. I can now easily explain how to play the game to anyone, but I think they would have trouble if I threw the printed rule book at them and told them to read.

Let’s all lift our glasses up for a toast on a great game! Let’s get this funded. Cheers!

Overall Score: 7.8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dan--Thanks so much for testing the PnP. Your review is a very accurate portrayal of the game, and I appreciate you taking the time to put it together. I'm confident the rules will be easier to understand when they're full illustrated--concepts like harvesting and crushing grapes are better explained in graphical form. But I definitely appreciate you slogging through the wordy version.

Six copies of the game are available for $179 plus shipping (it says $20 for international shipping per pledge, rather than per copy, but this would need confirming) - and looks to me like it's well worth a punt....five others interested?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Craig--I appreciate you organizing this group buy--I definitely want to get the game in the hands of international gamers. I've been thinking about the shipping for that level, though, and I know I'm going to lose money on that item if I don't increase it from $20. I want to respect the $30/game price point I've established at that level (before shipping), but I think I'm going to add a note about international shipping. For example, to ship a package that big to the UK, it will cost me about $72 in shipping expenses (according the the US post office). I'm willing to eat some of that--do you think $50 is reasonable?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Craig,

I've currently pledged for this as an early bird but would be up for swapping out for a group pledge if it goes ahead. If shipping is $50 that still means that the game plus expansion shipped would only be $38 (plus customs charges) Which sounds a bit of a bargain to me.

Cheers,
Tyler

With some clever and game-improving stretch goals, fun things to unlock via some innovative (and easy to support) methods, and not to mention a great idea for a game, this KickStarter campaign is one to watch.

There's even a risk-free guarantee!

Take a look: Viticulture on KickStarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Jason! I appreciate your confidence in the game, and I'm glad you like the way we set up our Kickstarter page.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I love Sideways, that was a great Kickstarter video. Definitely made me chuckle.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I just wanted for people who have supported the Kickstarter campaign or are considering it to have a place to interact. I'm happy to answer any questions you have.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The international shipping for $20, does that include places like Australia?

Thanks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the Kickstarter page it says
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note the expression "all other countries", so it should include Australia
